[2006/05/05] - RaX : Overview - CINCO DE MAYO, Reorganized a large part of the code.
[2006/05/05] - RaX : Moved Console commands back into TCommands class
[2006/05/05] - RaX : Reorganized startup messages into an outline format.

 and it seems to be uncrashable. Hopefully this will be a good building block for the other servers.
