 Still no connection for the RO Client to make the connection to the Zone just yet.
[2007/01/14] - Tsusai - ServerToServerPackets.txt - contains all packet documentation of
 server to server communications.
[2007/01/14] - Tsusai - Database\packet_db.txt - Added new packets for chara<->zone packets.

 messages.).
[2007/01/14] - Tsusai - List32 - Replaced IndexOfObject.  I don't know wtf the writers
 were thinking. It was taking an integer instead of an object -_-
[2007/01/14] - Tsusai - TCPServerRoutines - Updated the CommClient creation for the above
 update.
[2007/01/14] - Tsusai - ZoneOptions - Added missing entries, such as CharaServer location

-

- Rev 109 -
[2007/01/13] - Tsusai - Notes/Overview: Fixes and partial commits to character server for
 zone connections.
[2007/01/13] - Tsusai - CharacterServer : Added fZoneServerList, OnDisconnect Method, 
 updated SendCharaToMap to take on a connection and buffer parameter, Corrected error constant
 numbers (was getting email error where could not happen error should be, and vice versa.
 Please verify this change RaX). Added commented out code in SendcharaToMap. Fixed StatPoint
 display in CreateChara.  Removed unneeded If connected check in ParseCharaServ.

-

- Rev 108 -
[2007/01/12] - Tsusai - Notes/Overview: Fixed the outstanding JanSQL character server table
 errors.  We were trying to save and release a table that was already released due to 
 LoadChara releasing.
[2007/01/12] - Tsusai - JanSQLGameDatabase - Overrode the GetChara procedure.  Now takes a
 flag to release the table after loading of a character. LoadChara NO LONGER releases the
 table, since GetChara is the only thing that calls it and takes care of it if it needs to.
[2007/01/12] - Tsusai - LoginServer - Fixed my January 2006 entries...its 2007 now.
-

- Rev 107 -
[2007/01/12] - RaX - Modified Database.ini and The Database constructor to support setting
 each database's type individually. (IE - Common : text Game : SQL Static : Text)

[2007/01/10] - RaX - Updated Static->maps table : removed .gat extensions from mapnames.
[2007/01/10] - RaX - Added one query to StaticDatabase, GetMapCanSave(MapName). Returns
 a boolean indicating if a character can save on said map or not.
-

- Rev 103 -
[2007/01/10] - RaX - Notes/Overview : Database changes, broke up the database class into 3
 separate database classes (Common, Game, and Static).
[2007/01/10] - RaX - Deleted old database units.
[2007/01/10] - RaX - Added new database units (one of each of the old per database). Moved
 units into separate folders inside the database folder under classes.

 has been renamed to just 'maps'.
[2007/01/10] - RaX - Updated jansql databases to reflect mysql changes.
[2007/01/10] - RaX - Reorganized how each database is created and free'd.

-

- Rev 101 -
[2007/01/08] - Tsusai - Notes/Overview: Modifications to allow WAN/LAN checking complete
 and in place.
[2007/01/08] - Tsusai - WinLinux: Added a record type called TIPSet, which contains 2 strings,
 Full, and Partial.  This is to store more things for the result type of 
 GetIPStringFromHostname.
[2007/01/08] - Tsusai - WinLinux - GetIPStringFromHostname: Now returns a TIPSet type, 
 the Full IP that is obtained and a Partial (X.X.X.) The last . is for prevention of comparing
 192.168.10.1 to the partial of 192.168.1
[2007/01/08] - Tsusai - Inter/Zone servers: Disabled IP and IPCardinal code.  Will reactivate
 properly later.
[2007/01/08] - Tsusai - CharaServerInfo: Overhauled ip / port information. changed the storage
 strings that would store pure IPs as what they originally are, instead of parsing the IPs
 from a hostname for example.  WANPort -> Port.  Added fLANPartial to store the partial LAN
 IP.  Added Function Address, which takes a IP string of the client, for checking against 
 the LAN IP Partial that is stored.
[2007/01/08] - Tsusai - LoginServer - SendCharacterServers: Changed the WANCardinal and
 placed the Address() function in it is placed.
[2007/01/08] - Tsusai - LoginServer - VerifyCharaServer: Changed the WANPort to Port.
[2007/01/08] - Tsusai - LoginServer - ParseLogin: Changed the incoming WAN and LAN information
 to the fixed names.
-

- Rev 100 -
[2007/01/08] - Tsusai - Notes/Overview: Fixed JanSQL Queries, and a tweak to janSQL and 
 CommClient.
[2007/01/08] - Tsusai - CommClient: Once again reorganized order of procedures when relating
 to disconnecting and suspending the client thread.
[2007/01/08] - Tsusai - janSQL: Modified anything relating to file I/O to use / in the path,
 instead of \ due to linux issues.
[2007/01/08] - Tsusai - JanSQLDatabase: Updated any missing %s strings to have quotes
 surrounding, janSQL doesn't like them too much and goofs w/o errors.
-

- Rev 99 -
[2007/01/08] - RaX - Forgot to remove madexcept from linux includes, removed.
-

- Rev 98 -
[2007/01/07] - RaX - Updated JanSQL queries, SAVE TABLE and RELEASE TABLE instead of SAVE
 and RELEASE.
-

- Rev 97 -
[2007/01/07] - RaX - Notes/Overview : Split up ServerOptions.ini into one ini for each
 server, one for database, and one for general helios config(enabled servers).
[2007/01/07] - RaX - Added LoginOptions, CharaOptions, InterOptions, ZoneOptions,
 DatabaseOptions, and HeliosOptions.
[2007/01/07] - RaX - Removed serverOptions.
[2007/01/07] - RaX - Removed ServerConfig from Globals.
[2007/01/07] - RaX - Added public property, Options, to each server. Options is the ini for
 each.
[2007/01/07] - RaX - Added Options to MainProc and Database.
[2007/01/07] - RaX - Changed Database class system so that each Database Template Child is
 created with a parent argument, allowing Options to be called from inside the child classes
 rather than having to have it passed into it.
[2007/01/07] - RaX - Cleaned up unused variables in ZoneServer.
[2007/01/07] - RaX - Re-organized uses in Helios.dpr to be organized first by category, and
 then alphabetically for better classification.
[2007/01/07] - RaX - Added more inter communication variables to ZoneServer, in preparation
 for zone->chara and zone->inter communication.
-

- Rev 96 -
[2007/01/04] - RaX - Added Headers to CommClient and updated Globals'.
[2007/01/04] - RaX - Changed server.start routines to use a hidden parameter, reload, which
 tells it whether to reload the ini or not.
[2007/01/04] - RaX - Added and implemented Globals - LoadIni; for the above change. LoadIni
 Free's ServerConfig if it's assigned, and recreates it.
-

- Rev 95 -
[2007/01/04] - Tsusai - Reorganized the suspending code of the CommClient thread. 
 Apparently it would halt the thread (good) but not disconnect (bad).
-

- Rev 94 -
[2007/01/04] - RaX - Updated documentation + headers in LoginServer. Added /help command
 listings for new /start and /stop commands in Commands.
[2007/01/04] - RaX - Added Started property to each server class.
[2007/01/04] - RaX - Changed /start and /stop to use already build in <server>.start procedures
 and modified them to work with servers which aren't free'd.
-

- Rev 93 -
[2007/01/03] - Tsusai - Notes/Overview : Implemented the GetPacketLength function, and added
 some new console output messages to let admins know what is going on with login and character
 servers.
[2007/01/03] - Tsusai - DatabaseTXT: Allowed Load_PacketDB be called outside of that unit.
[2007/01/03] - Tsusai - Added the following files into Notes: client_packet_en (from
 prometheus), and Generating Linux Compiles.txt
[2007/01/03] - Tsusai - Database\packet_db.txt - Added Helios custom packets (server
 communication packets).
[2007/01/03] - Tsusai - Globals - InitGlobals:  Calls Load_PacketDB.
[2007/01/03] - Tsusai - TCPServerRoutines - DeactivateServer: Added termination messages,
 and is passed a name for those messages.
[2007/01/03] - Tsusai - LoginServer, CharaServer, InterServer, ZoneServer: Updated
 DeactivateServer calls.
[2007/01/03] - Tsusai - Console : Added a blank space after the server startup.
[2007/01/03] - Tsusai - LoginServer, CharaServer, CharaLoginPackets : Updated static packet
 lengths (Recv and Send) with the GetPacketLength function.
-

- Rev 92 -
[2007/01/03] - RaX - Added 2 ini entries, [Login] - Key and [Chara] - LoginKey. Now we can
 specify the password used to communicate between the login and character servers.
-

- Rev 91 -
[2007/01/02] - RaX - Thanks to research done by Tsusai, our text database works with
 multiple exes.
[2007/01/02] - RaX - Changed JanSQLDatabase to save and release after each update/insert/
 delete and just release after each select, this causes the text database to reload itself
 before queries, allowing real-time data changes in a text database =o.
-

- Rev 90 -
[2006/12/30] - RaX - Pretty much redid the database reorganization of the last commit.
 Moved Databases to be a private entity of each server. Zone is the exception, multiple
 file rely on the zone's database since we don't want the zone server file to be, well,
 HUGE =)

	NOTE::: The 12/28 client works, but is quirky. There seems to be some missing
 		padding in create character and delete character, because results for each
		are random. Tsusai, can you sniff the exe and see what's missing? Maybe
		it'll be a simple feature to add. I'll e-mail it to you par request.
-

- Rev 89 -
[2006/12/29] - RaX - Added my e-mail address to the helios.dpr header.
[2006/12/29] - RaX - Moved Database creates and frees around to assign each dynamically
 based on which servers are enabled.
[2006/12/29] - RaX - Added new console commands, start and stop. For example, /start login
 would create and start the login server. /stop login would stop and free the login server.
-

- Rev 88 -
[2006/12/28] - Tsusai - Forgot to put back the Account field in the LoadChara in both existing
 database calls.
-

- Rev 87 - 
[2006/12/28] - RaX - Added the 12/28 client to our packet_db.
-

- Rev 86 -
[2006/12/27] - Tsusai - Notes/Overview: More updates to the multi character server coding,
 mainly side effect bugfixes.
[2006/12/27] - Tsusai - Account - GetBanned and GetConnectTime: Removed the SQL calls,
 and simplied.
[2006/12/27] - Tsusai - CommClient - TClientThread.Execute: tweaked the try/except field.
[2006/12/27] - Tsusai - MySQLDatabase, JanSQLDatabase, DatabaseTemplate: Changed
 GetAccountBanAndConnectTime to RefreshAccountData.
[2006/12/27] - Tsusai - MySQLDatabase, JanSQLDatabase : Fixed GenderChar and LoginKey
 reading in SetAccount, modified GetAccount (both types) to be more efficient, and
 read the new RefreshAccountData that is required. RefreshAccountData reads the ban and
 connect (play) time, and the login keys.
-

- Rev 85 -
[2006/12/26] - RaX - Oops, forgot to remove some code from a previous method of getting a
 new character's id in JanSQLDatabase. CreateChara.
-

- Rev 84 -
[2006/12/24] - RaX - Added default values to TCharacters in CreateChara(CharacterServer).
-

- Rev 83 -
[2006/12/24] - Tsusai - Notes/Overview: Unfortnately a large commit.  This commit includes
 the ability to finally start linking 2 exes together, at the characterserver level.  Thats
 right, running two copies correctly, can result in having two servers listed at the server
 selection menu after login.  Also many Uses have been cleaned up.
[2006/12/24] - Tsusai - Added the following units: CharacterServerInfo, CharaLoginPackets,
 and CommClient.
[2006/12/24] - Tsusai - CharacterServerInfo : Contains a type that houses information on a
 Character Server, such as WAN/LAN IPs, port, Servername, and online users.  These are stored
 in a list that is read from when someone logs in, and is sent a list.
[2006/12/24] - Tsusai - CharaLoginPackets : Contain all Outgoing routines at the moment.
[2006/12/24] - Tsusai - CommClient : Contains a Indy TCP Client descendant, which controls
 a generated thread.  The thread checks for connection and tries to connect every 30 seconds.
 It also figures out if there is data available and passes it on as a OnRecieve event.
[2006/12/24] - Tsusai - InterServer, ZoneServer : Turned off their built in clients for now.
[2006/12/24] - Tsusai - Console : Removed static list entry for the character servers 
 (our workaround until this was done).
[2006/12/24] - Tsusai - TCPServerRoutines (NEEDS RENAMING NOW) : Replaced all TIdTCPClients
 with TInterClient, and updated Activate/Deactivate Client as needed.  Also removed crap out
 of DeactivateServer for now.  I think we won't suffer that problem we did in Prometheus.
[2006/12/24] - Tsusai - PacketTypes : Added TCharaServerLink type which is used in LoginServer.
[2006/12/24] - Tsusai - Globals : Removed UTF8String (its still just string), Cleaned up uses,
 removed CharacterServerList (now private in LoginServer as it should be). Added IncMinute and
 IncSecond routines.
[2006/12/24] - Tsusai - BufferIO : Added WriteBufferMD5String to write the bytes as they are
 into buffer, and ReadBufferMD5 to read the bytes directly from the buffer.  Overloaded
 SendBuffer and RecvBuffer to accept TInterClient as a passed parameter.  Fixed
 BufferReadString's parameters.
[2006/12/24] - Tsusai - mwStringHashList : Fixed Uses.
[2006/12/24] - Tsusai - Character - SetSaveTime: Uses IncMinute from Globals now.
[2006/12/24] - Tsusai - LoginServer - Cleaned uses, Removed OnExecute Event, tied
 ParseLoginServer directly to it.  Added OnDiscconect method, to remove character server 
 information from the list if that particular client disconnected. CharaServerList has been
 moved here and is a private field. Removed ReadMD5Password (in BufferIO now).  Updated
 parameters of ValidateLogin and SendLoginError. Added VerifyCharaServer to validate
 (static validate for now).  Fixed the packet indexes and loop for SendCharacterServers.
 Added Parsing of charaserv client packets to ParseLogin.  Will be fined tuned in a later
 commit.
[2006/12/24] - Tsusai - CharacterServer : Removed anything having to do with the translation
 of IP/Hostname strings into cardinals. Added CharaToLoginClient, and events for it (OnConnected
 and OnRecieve). Removed CharacterServer.OnExecute, using ParseCharaServ directly. Added the 
 setting of Host/Port of the CharaToLoginClient in .Start for now.  Also removed the While
 from ParseCharaServer, not needed.
[2006/12/24] - Tsusai - Added Packet documentation for Chara<->login communications to Notes
[2006/12/24] - Tsusai - Removed Subdirectories in obj, not needed.
-

- Rev 82 -
[2006/12/23] - RaX - Reordered Character Deletion Errors in CharacterServer due to some
 weird error messages.
-

- Rev 81 -
[2006/12/23] - RaX - Notes/Overview - Implemented new FASTER character list and fixed a bug
 in JanSQLDatabase.
[2006/12/23] - RaX - Added CharaList.pas, a low level TCharacterList which is as fast as it
 gets I believe.
[2006/12/23] - RaX - Updated CharaExists both overloads in JanSQLDatabase.pas. Both weren't
 looking at the record count, only at the result identifier, and if there are records to be
 found, Jan returns an identifier, which is why it worked with no characters in the
 database =)
[2006/12/23] - RaX - Changed Globals to use a TCharacterList instead of a TIntList32 as the
 global characterlist.
[2006/12/23] - RaX - Changed CharacterServer to use the new characterlist.
[2006/12/23] - RaX - Changed JanSQL + MySQL + DatabaseTemplate to use the new list.
-

- Rev 80 -
[2006/12/23] - Muad_Dib - Added new jobs (ninja, gunslinger, xmas suit) to GameConstants.
-

- Rev 79 -
[2006/12/23] - RaX - Added Updated jAthena Packet_db. Fully updated.
-

- Rev 78 -
[2006/12/22] - RaX - Added GetPacketLength to TCPServerRoutines.
-

- Rev 77-
[2006/12/22] - RaX - Confusion on my part, NOW the characterlist bug is fixed with no leaks
[2006/12/22] - RaX - Updated headers in all files.
[2006/12/22] - RaX - Moved ServerException into each of the server classes.
[2006/12/22] - RaX - Cleaned up uses in Console.pas.
-

- Rev 76-
[2006/12/21] - RaX - Fixed CharacterList Corruption bug. We were free'ing ACharacter after
 it was already free'd in CharacterList.Delete which caused a crash.(JanSQLDatabase,
 MySQLDatabase)
-

- Rev 75-
[2006/12/21] - RaX - Removed Deprecated units AccountDB, SQL, and SaveThread. Leaving
 XTimer in case we need a timer.
-

- Rev 74-
[2006/12/21] - RaX - Updated JanSQLDatabase queries to work with jansql. (JanSQLDatabase)
[2006/12/21] - RaX - Changed StrToInt to StrToIntDef with a default of 0 in LoadChara
 because JanSQL doesn't support default values or typing for that matter.
[2006/12/21] - RaX - Added calculations for the next available ID to CreateChara, see above
 for details as to why.
-

- Rev 73-
[2006/12/21] - Tsusai - Notes/Overview: Renamed unit Socket to BufferIO.  All applicable 
 files were updated.
-

- Rev 72-
[2006/12/21] - RaX - Modified JanSQLDatabase.pas to use resultidentifier numbers to access
 the internal list of recordsets rather than using passed QueryResult pointers. Freeing
 these was causing JanSQL to corrupt it's internal list and cause random crashes. Also,
 the result list would get unbearably huge after a short time =) from now on we use
 Database.ReleaseRecordset(ResultIdentifier : Integer) to free our query results in jan.
[2006/12/21] - RaX - Modified MySQLDatabase and JanSQLDatabase in GetBanAndConnect to use
 special queries rather than just reloading the entire account.
[2006/12/21] - RaX - changed serveroptions.ini to have the default database host as ./save
 to allow jansql to work out of the box.
[2006/12/21] - RaX - added jansql database to the save folder in trunk/bin.
-

- Rev 71-
[2006/12/20] - Tsusai - Notes/Overview: Updates to database system.
[2006/12/20] - Tsusai - DatabaseTemplate: Modified CONNECT to use out current standard
 parameters, instead of using reintroduces and overrides in the children classes.
[2006/12/20] - Tsusai - MySQLDatabase & JanSQLDatabase - SaveAccount: Removed StrToInt64
 conversions of dates.  Just strings now.
[2006/12/20] - Tsusai - JanSQLDatabase - SaveAccount: Fixed how the dates are stored back
 into the database. This caused problems of the same account trying to reconnect, and bad
 times being read when logging BACK in.
[2006/12/20] - Tsusai - JanSQLDatabase: Added Disconnect method, which calls the commit
 query to save the database.
-

- Rev 70-
[2006/12/19] - Tsusai - Oopsie.  Didn't know my runtime debug parameters were saving. Removed
-

- Rev 69-
[2006/12/19] - Tsusai - Heh...69.                     Sorry..couldn't help myself
[2006/12/19] - Tsusai - Accounts: For some reason if a person attempted to login with the mf 
 suffix for auto account creation on MD5 connection, following connections would be told
 they have no more game time. The Now procedure was somehow not returning, but with
 SysUtils.Now as the replacement, it works.  Not too sure if something is causing a conflict
 with it, but it should be sound now.

 ServerOptions.ini for this.
[2006/11/14] - Tsusai - CharaServerProcess - SendCharas: Fixed bug where Index would do a
 ERangeError, because of 0 characters being returned.  Also fixed a database call that was

 works proper.
[2006/11/13] - Tsusai - DatabaseTemplate - Reindented.

[2006/11/13] - Tsusai - CharaServerProcesses - Updated any TDatabase creations to make sure
 the right database is accessed.
[2006/11/13] - Tsusai - MySQLDatabase - TMySQLDatabase : Placed "Connection" into private,
 Overrode Create and Connect method to take a boolean flag for which database to use. Added
 a SendQuery (use just like query).  If a Query actually fails to execute, a visual error
 will happen and the query pasted to the console.

 not needed.
[2006/11/12] - Tsusai - WinLinux : Added a PriorityLow global constant.  Windows has tpLowest
 while Linux is an integer (PRIO_MIN).
[2006/11/12] - Tsusai - XTimer - TXTimer.Execute : Priority is now set to PriorityLow
 constant. (Exisiting was not cross compilable)

- Rev 48-
[2006/11/11] - Tsusai - BUGFIX (God I did not want to see one of these...).  Removed the
 usage of FreeAndNil(ADatabase); that RaX implemented.  Replaced with ADatabase.Free;  Odd
 thing was that once a person logged into character server, it would no longer accept any
 more connections.
[2006/11/11] - Tsusai - ZoneCore & Console - Reindented.
[2006/11/11] - Tsusai - Globals - MakeRNDString added, generates a random string based on

 client info, and stored the randomly generated key in it (ONLY WHEN MD5 CONNECTIONS ARE USED)
-

- Rev 47-
[2006/11/06] - Tsusai - Merged GameGlobals into GameConstants, and updated any/all units
 that used to call GameGlobals.
 out a better timer, so for now, we have seconds.
[2006/11/06] - Tsusai - Updated 3rdParty.txt to mention we are using uMySQL** under MySQL's
 FLOSS exception.
[2006/11/06] - Tsusai - Extracted the version string to its own unit, to keep revisions to
 Globals separate.
-

- Rev 46-
[2006/11/03] - RaX - Rewrote XTimer to fix problems with processors that modulate their
 clock speed. Changed resolution to seconds. We can't have lower resolutions until I figure
 out a better timer, so for now, we have seconds.
[2006/11/03] - RaX - Changed ini loading to load default 60 for SaveTimer.Interval.
[2006/11/03] - RaX - Changed Console.Pas to accomodate our new changes.
-

- Rev 45-
[2006/11/02] - RaX - Updated ThirdParty.txt to include Indy. Also, corrected mistakes made
 by yours truly in the umysqlclient credits. "There is no Spoof", you could say. Updated to
 "Part 10" of the GNU license.
-

- Rev 44-
[2006/11/01] - RaX - Map.pas - Implemented Tsusai's changed to GetPath which include, but
 are not limited to, the following...
	GetPath changed to a boolean function with APath as a parameter passed by address.
	Addition of IsBlocked to check for passability versus a multi-line condition.
[2006/11/01] - RaX - Map.pas - Added GetArea, a private method of TMap which creates a
 search area based on our constant CHAR_CLICKAREA distance away from the starting point.
[2006/11/02] - RaX - moved CHAR_CLICKAREA into Constants/GameConstants.pas.
[2006/11/02] - RaX - Added GameConstants.pas.
-

- Rev 43-
[2006/10/31] - RaX - Modified Map.pas - GetPath to return a TPointList instead of an Array
[2006/10/31] - RaX - moved constant CHAR_CLICKAREA to implementation,
 created Directions constant array of tpoints which contains the distance to go from the
 starting point to get the point in said direction.
[2006/10/31] - RaX - changed TMap.Graph to an array of array of TPoint.
-

- Rev 42-
[2006/10/30] - RaX - Added Classes/Map.Pas - our TMap map class. Stubbed, only contains our
 pathfinding algorithm for now. The Pathfinder is a "floodfill" or "wave" search that finds
 the shortest path between 2 points by flooding the graph with tracers that keep track of
 where they've been. The first one to reach the end's path is the shortest path.
-

- Rev 41-
[2006/10/23] - RaX - Random cleanup in LoginProcess, removed unused variables and function
 calls from our former Indy9 socket.
-

- Rev 40-
[2006/10/23] - RaX - Updated XTimer to have a Resolution property which is defined by constants
 to reflect the accuracy fo the timer, between nanoseconds and seconds. XTimer is now much
 more accurate than before as well.
[2006/10/23] - RaX - Added variables to ServerConfig to enable/disable and set the interval
 for the Save Loop.
-

- Rev 39-
[2006/10/21] - RaX - Re-Added XTimer.pas (it works correctly now, and better!) changed over
 SaveLoop.pas into what it was supposed to be, the save thread only, executed by XTimer.
 XTimer is now a reuseable timer with a real resolution of 1ms ...the defining element is
 assembly....go me. Will be updated to really get accurate time down to the clock speed of
 the processor (faster the clock speed, the more accurate the timer).
[2006/10/21] - RaX - Added our license to the header of Helios.dpr.
[2006/10/21] - RaX - Added ThirdParty.txt contents. Basic, but effective.
-

- Rev 38-
[2006/10/20] - Tsusai - Upgraded things to Indy 10. All old outstanding writebuffers now use
 Socket.SendBuffer.
[2006/10/20] - Tsusai - Console: Updated all TIdPeerThreads to TIdContext, and renamed
 AThread to AConnection.
[2006/10/20] - Tsusai - Socket: Updated SendPading to use SendBuffer.  SendBuffer now
 converts OUR buffer to Indy bytebits to send out (it took 3 hours to get sending to work
 right).  Also added a RecvBuffer, to handle recieving packets and putting them into a buffer.
[2006/10/20] - Tsusai - TCPServerRoutines: Updated threads to contexts in DeactivateServer.
[2006/10/20] - Tsusai - Login/Zone/Chara : Updated all peerthreads to contexts, removed
 ReadFromStack, redid the input buffer size call, and implemented SendBuffer (if missing)
 and RecvBuffer.
-

- Rev 37-
[2006/10/13] - Tsusai - Friday October 13th....Just as creepy as 06/06/06
[2006/10/13] - Tsusai - LoginProcesses: Separated the validation code from ParseLogin, and
 added MD5 client connection support.
-

- Rev 36-
[2006/10/10] - RaX - Code cleanup...
[2006/10/10] - RaX - moved Run from Helios.dpr to MainProc as a property for organization.
[2006/10/10] - RaX - Moved around save loop creates and destroys around in MainProc to make
 it force a save before the loop shuts down and free and recreate on restart.
[2006/10/10] - RaX - Added TSaveLoop.Save which will house the actual save code... to allow
 forcing a full save by simply calling this procedure from outside the thread.
-

- Rev 35-
[2006/10/09] - RaX - Fixed my timer. It wasn't allowing console commands (for some unknown
 reason). Removed XTimer, moved everything into SaveLoop...no more Enabled Property.
 {Thank you Tsusai}
-

- Rev 34-
[2006/10/06] - RaX - Updated XTimer.pas to work with Delphi 7 (Self.Ontimer(); vs OnTimer());
-

- Rev 33-
[2006/10/06] - RaX - Overview - stubbed out the save loop thread routines and built a timer
 for us to use.
[2006/10/06] - RaX - FIXED - Added CharaList.pas - forgot to last commit (sorry).
[2006/10/06] - RaX - Added SaveTimer to MainProc, a threaded Timer I wrote.
[2006/10/06] - RaX - Added TXTimer (Classes/XTimer.pas), a timer thread meant for the save.
 loop.
[2006/10/06] - RaX - Added TSaveLoop(Classes/SaveLoop.pas) - our Saving thread.
[2006/10/06] - RaX - How it works - The Timer runs in background forever. At Interval ms,
 it executes the saveloop, which runs outside of the execution path of both MainProc, and
 the timer itself. After saving, the SaveLoop automatically free's itself.
-

- Rev 32- BROKEN
[2006/10/06] - RaX - Finished implementation of the Database system and made it thread-safe
 (we now use a local, to the object instance, connection rather than the old global one.)
[2006/10/06] - RaX - CharaServerProcess - ripped out lingering sql queries and moved them 
 into the databaseing units, created CharaExists(overloaded) and GetAccountCharas to replace
 them.
[2006/10/06] - RaX - Removed old SQL.pas from project, still on SVN for posterities sake.
[2006/10/06] - RaX - Removed SQLConnected from MainProc (console.pas).

 procedure.
[2006/10/04] - Tsusai - ZoneRecv : Updated the NoCommand procedure to be compatable by the
 above changes.
-

- Rev 30-

[2006/10/01] - Tsusai - DatabaseTemplate/MySQLDatabase : Moved TCharacter SQL methods here
 from Character.pas
[2006/10/01] - Tsusai - CharaServerProcesses : Updated calls for the above changes.
Note : Database units not organized...was busy with functionality.  Also, need to verify
any use of TDatabase is cleaned up after we are done with it (FreeAndNil() or .Free).
-

- Rev 29-
[2006/09/30] - RaX - Updated new database organization, removed CreateDatabase and created
 a "wrapper" class for our Multi-database interface which, on create, decides what interface
 to use.
[2006/09/30] - RaX - Added - Classes/Database.pas
[2006/09/30] - RaX - Renamed - Classes/Database/Database.pas to DatabaseTemplate.pas.

[2006/09/29] - RaX - Overview - HUGE CHANGE, finally added our plug and play database system.
 this is, well, unique in RO emulators. The ability to swap between database types at the 
 flip of a switch is handy, of course, but giving people more choices in databasing is
 extremely useful.
[2006/09/29] - RaX - Added Classes/Database/Database.pas
[2006/09/29] - RaX - Added Classes/Database/MySQLDatabase.pas
[2006/09/29] - RaX - Added Constants/DatabaseConstants.pas
[2006/09/29] - RaX - changed LoginProcesses to use the new database system rather than

[2006/05/05] - RaX : Overview - CINCO DE MAYO, Reorganized a large part of the code.
[2006/05/05] - RaX : Moved Console commands back into TCommands class
[2006/05/05] - RaX : Reorganized startup messages into an outline format.
[2006/05/05] - RaX : Redid the main loop to allow TCommands.Exit to exit the loop.
[2006/05/05] - RaX : Added check at the beginning of TCommands.Parse to see if the string was
 blank, if it was blank, it would not exexute the parsing routine.
[2006/05/05] - RaX : Finally, I tested the changes. Everything checks out ok. There seems to 
 be no memory leaks, and it seems to be uncrashable. Hopefully this will be a good building
 block for the other servers.
-

- Rev 39-
[2006/05/04] - Tsusai : The original bug problem was that i was using a byte type for the
 loop. 0 to -1 crashes with the range error, due to the fact byte type cannot be less than 0.
  Fixed.
-

- Rev 38-
[2006/05/04] - RaX : Bugfix :: If there aren't any charaservers in charaserverlist, there

	Commands.pas : removed
	Socket.pas : removed tsocket class, but kept procedures.  Those procedures are
                     enough, don't need to create and destroy classes (memory) over and
                     over just yet. not till we have game objects in place.
	Database.pas : moved Reload here from Commands
