[2008/02/10] Tsusai - Notes/Overview: Updates for Linux Lazarus to compile.
 Kylix will no longer work. Why compile w/ an old kernel than a new one?
[2008/02/10] Tsusai - Helios Project File: Disabled Linux "CRT" related fields.
 These fuck up the display...badly.
[2008/02/10] Tsusai - CRTWrapper: Removed Linux Code for now.
[2008/02/10] Tsusai - Globals: Removed CRT Termination.
[2008/02/10] Tsusai - LuaPas: Updated linux library name.  If it still doesn't
 work or compile, make a symbolic link to fix this.
[2008/02/10] Tsusai - SQLite3: Added a unit so LoadLibrary & family work in
 Lazarus.
[2008/02/10] Tsusai - WinLinux: Modified the elapsed time code to use datetime

 can now be compiled using Lazarus Win64 on a Windows x64 environment.
[2008/02/09] Tsusai - Bin Folder: Added 64bit compiles of lua and sqlite3 dlls 
 into  a Libraries folder.  Moved existing 32bit compiles into a 32bit folder for
 consistency.
[2008/02/09] Tsusai - CRT: Changed to CRTWrapper.pas to avoid conflict with
 the FPC RTL unit "CRT".
[2008/02/09] Tsusai - CRTWrapper: Cleaned up.  Linux visual mods removed.
[2008/02/09] Tsusai - WinConsole: FPC will now ignore the Inline Assembly until
 someone knows how to use it proper.
[2008/02/09] Tsusai - List32.ExchangeItems: Ignoring some typecasting.  FPC can't
 figure out wtf is going on, and I don't know how to fix it for FPC.
[2008/02/09] Tsusai - Helios64.res: Added. Contains manifest so lua can link to
 a .NET framework item to operate.
[2008/02/09] Tsusai - Globals/Terminal: Updated for CRT->CRTWrapper rename.

[2008/02/01] Aeomin - Tweak on TIntList32, changed Cardinal to LongWord and removed ASM that will break on x64.
-

[2008/01/30] RaX - Fixed bug in last commit, changing TThread to TIdThread was

-

- Rev 430 -
[2008/01/29] RaX - More random cleanup, commented, renamed, and organized stuff
 relating to the Commclient. Added an event (OnReconnect) which fires when the
 client loses it's connection and starts to reconnect. This client is almost
 ready to be distributed by itself, as in you can easily use it in other applications
 outside helios.
- 

- Rev 429 -
[2008/01/29] RaX - Random Cleanup, uses, some potential warnings removed, etc.
-

- Rev 428 -
[2008/01/26] RaX - Helios is now officially lazarus compatible. Removed MySQL
 due to our client library's crappiness. MySQL reimplementation pending move to
 ZeOSLib, which will replace our databasing system as it stands right now.
 Modified every project file adding ifdefs for fpc and setting the compiler MODE
 to Delphi. 

	TODO:: Reimplement List32.pas(IntList32) due to it's inline assembler.
	       Swap out databasing components for ZeosLib.

You will need a specially modified version of indy10 to compile Helios for lazarus
because md5 is broken natively in the lazarus distribution. Contact me to get ahold
of it.
-


- Rev 427 -

 this seems to work well.

 of just checking the count, I had forgotten that OnTouchevents were also stored

[2007/11/25] Aeomin - Temperary fix normal warp stuck problem.
Cause of problem : Since server is multithread, loop the event list and fire each 
even is a seperated thread than each player connection. Chances are, threads want 
to delete an entry in EventList AT SAME time, result was AV, on client side, it was 
stucked.
Solution : Currently i have no perfect solution yet, might someone help out, but i did 
put a limit check in eventlist, since currently Helios does not have much of effect,
on debug, only event was walk. Thread 1 delete walk event(ZoneSend), Meanwhile: Thread 2 
Fires walk event (event deleted at this point), thread 2 try to delete an index that 
does not exists anymore.

 Halt.

 a table, so I went ahead and made it return one regardless, so that the data
 could be freed.

 it may be freed.

[2007/06/03] CR - Overview: Bugfix: Reverting BufferReadString to the old 
 original style weiss/eWeiss/Fusion/Prometheus RFIFOS code.  Yes, it uses a BIG 
 buffer, but...  Yes, it works correctly, as it did originally.  Now clients can
 re-logon without being refused and given a "Failed to connect to server" error
 when they use their username/password again.
[2007/06/03] CR - BufferIO: BufferReadString: Bugfix - allows clients to re-
 login now.  Thoroughly commented code, and pre-requisite assertions, so that
 no one haphazardly goes into this code to "improve" it without knowing the
 perils before them.

[2007/06/02] CR - Overview: Bugfix: Memory leak fix in our Zone server.  This
 would end up being a larger leak in time, because we are *JUST* starting to add
 NPC scripting.  Thanks to Tsusai for the heads-up on where to look here.
[2007/06/02] CR - ZoneServer: TZoneServer.Destroy: Improved description.
 Bugfix: Memory leak plugged -- NPCList objects are now freed before freeing
 the list itself.  Did the research, and RaX's lists for MapList and
 CharacterList are self-cleaning (Good job there!).
 Added comments to point out which are potentially unsafe Free calls.

- Rev 278 -
[2007/06/02] CR - Overview: Cleanup commit.
[2007/06/01] CR - InterRecv: RecvGMCommand: Made all parameters constant.
 Added try-finally construct around the use of the local TStringList, to
 safeguard against a memory leak if InterSendGMCommandToZones were to cause
 errors.
[2007/06/01] CR - ZoneSend: ZoneSendGMCommandtoInter: Altered Comment Header,
 minor formatting/bracketing changes, use of try-finally to ensure no leaks if
 errors occur before our local Stringlist is freed.

- Rev 277 -
[2007/06/01] CR - Overview: Bugfix -- A memory leak plugged.  More still to plug
 yet, but YAY for Memproof!  Oh, and Happy Birthday to my sister! :)
[2007/06/01] CR - ZoneServer: TZoneServer.LoadMaps: Altered Comment Header.  
 Major Memory leak fixed. (649 maps as of this writing, so 649 dangling strings
 freed).  We now free MapNames on routine completion, since this routine owns 
 that object, it MUST clean it up.

[2007/05/27] CR - Overview: Bugfix!  Solved out 3 bugs with walking/pathing,
 two pointed out by Tsusai and RaX while testing NPC Warps, and then the map-
 edge errors found trying to quell the complaints about unwalkable tiles that
 shouldn't be.
  That said, there still remains an issue with some unwalkable tiles, while I
 was testing this on the new1-2 map at 100,9 (as Tsusai suggested to test).
 Situation:  the little "coves" to the left and right at the bottom, that are
 1x3 tiles aren't reachable.

  I'm committing my changes to solve the aformentioned 3 bugs, because that
 solves out 98% of the issues found, and now we'll have more people to test
 and sort out that last remaining pesky problem. :P :)

[2007/05/27] CR - Map TMap.GetPath: Applied 3 sets of bugfixes, two caused by
 my algorithm tweaks, one pre-existing:
 Mea Culpa:  Infinite Loops, and improper pathing when the mouse button is held
 down to walk are solved.
 Pre-existing and discovered while dealing with the rest: We failed to account
 for map edges properly in our 16 radius search range, and this caused improper
 coordinates to be sent for the path.  This one wasn't found right away,
 because we weren't testing on more than the new1-1 map.

[2007/05/25] Tsusai - Notes/Overview: Lua Updates
[2007/05/25] Tsusai - LuaCoreRoutines - MakeLuaThread: Finally got it to work
 the way I want it.  Creates a new execution thread, links to the original globals,
 and keeps its own globals.
[2007/05/25] Tsusai - LuaNPCCommands: Cleaned up USES, added the first real NPC
 command, "moveto".  
[2007/05/25] Tsusai - LuaNPCCommands - MakeNPCWarp: Forgot to add Job ID
 assignment.  
[2007/05/25] Tsusai - LuaNPCCore: Cleared up uses.

 retrieval of character data was successful.
[2007/05/25] Tsusai - LuaNPCCore - RunLuaNPCScript: Added termination of lua
 thread.  Not sure if that is a good spot or not.  I will know soon.

 ZoneServer, InterServer, InterRecv.
-

- Rev 265 -
[2007/05/25] Tsusai - Being - TBeing.Walk: Fixed The ontouch event firing, due
 to an array typo.  Also added sets the character to "standing" so the walk
 routine exits properly.
[2007/05/25] Tsusai - NPC - TScriptNPC.OnTouch: fixed caller (was executing the
 clicking version).
[2007/05/25] Tsusai - NPC - TScriptNPC.Enable & Disable: Fixed initial check to
 just check for OnTouchEnabled.
[2007/05/25] Tsusai - TWarpNPC.Create: Now automatically sets the warp npc to
 an enabled state.

- Rev 258 -
[2007/05/19] CR - Overview: Cleanup in InterServer unit.  Added class header,
 initial description of the purpose of the InterServer.  Made changes, including
 new properties that lend clarity to routines that used to do the casting work
 in-situ.
[2007/05/19] CR - InterServer - TInterServer.RecvGMCommandReply: Altered header,
 indent and style changes.  Use of new ClientList and ZoneServerLink property
 and a with clause to make code cleaner to read.
[2007/05/19] CR - InterServer - TInterServer.InterSendGMCommandToZones: Altered
 header, indent and style changes.  Extracted a local procedure to construct
 the packet ($2206), and slight optimizations made.  Used ClientList and
 ZoneServerLink properties for clarity.
[2007/05/19] CR - InterServer - TInterServer.RecvWhisper: Altered header,
 indent and style changes.  Use of with, and ZoneServerLink to clarify code.
[2007/05/19] CR - InterServer - TInterServer.RecvWhisperReply: Alterd Comment
 Header, indent and style changes.  Used ZoneServerLink and ClientLink
 properties to make code cleaner to read.
[2007/05/19] CR - InterServer - TInterServer.SetPort: Altered Comment Header.  
 Changed behavior so that fPort and TCPServer.DefaultPort are only altered IFF 
 Value is different from fPort.  Value parameter made constant.
[2007/05/19] CR - InterServer - TInterServer.GetClientList: Created routine.  
 Property read handler for ClientList.
[2007/05/19] CR - InterServer - TInterServer.GetZoneServerInfo: Created 
 routine.  Property read handler for ZoneServerInfo.
[2007/05/19] CR - InterServer - TInterServer.GetZoneServerLink: Created 
 routine.  Property Read handler for ZoneServerLink.
[2007/05/19] CR - InterServer - TInterServer.RecvZoneWarpRequest: Altered 
 Comment Header.  Indent and style changes, with clause added to declutter a 
 database value read.
-

- Rev 257 -
[2007/05/13] - Tsusai - Notes/Overview: Fixed packet_db/zone related parameters.
[2007/05/13] - Tsusai - Packet_Db: Modified ExecCommand types to have var and
 const for their parameters.
[2007/05/13] - Tsusai - ZoneRecv: Updated all parameters for the above.
[2007/05/13] - Tsusai - BufferIO: Added const/var to all parameters.
-

- Rev 256 -
[2007/05/08] - RaX - Fixed hints and warnings that Turbo Delphi failed to catch.
 I finally fixed my compiler!
-

- Rev 255 -
[2007/05/07] CR - Overview: Found the holy grail!  Speedup on pathing, with
 a combination of logic simplification, and finding the proper spot and 
 calculations for the Cost comparison.  Users should notice the faster pathing 
 with points selected near the edge of the character's view.
[2007/05/07] CR - Map - TMap.GetPath: Added to comment header to describe this
 routine's behavior further.  Refactored StepCost out of main routine, and
 improved the efficiency of that cost lookup by simplifying the comparison.
 Refactored out routines InitializeAnArea and GetOptimalDirection.
 Renamed local variables:  XMod and YMode now are Offset (TPoint), and
 EndPointMod is now AreaEndPoint.
 Using DiagonalCost to PROPERLY focus the search area.  In testing, this yields
 speeds half the time of the algorithm used in rev 254.  This proper cost
 comparison, along with the proper stepping DOWN the compared cost (not
 incrementing it!), and with use of GetOptimalDirection, we are now aiming the
 search toward the goal, and avoiding expensive searches that don't compute to
 a low-cost path.
-

- Rev 254 -
[2007/05/07] CR - Overview: Documentation and preparatory work in MapTypes for
 an improvement for Pathing on our maps.
[2007/05/07] CR - MapTypes: Added constants for the GAT values, taken verbatim
 from Prometheus beforehand.  I'm still a bit unsure that these have the
 correct names for the values.  Someone please, please double check!
[2007/05/07] CR - MapTypes - TFloodItem: Changed Cost to LongWord (same range,
 futureproofing for when Tsusai can't control his urge to compile 64 bit
 binaries whenever CodeGear releases a 64b compiler).  Added methods for finding
 the Manhattan and Diagonal Costs from the given item to a relative destination
 point.  Added both for completeness, but I'm only intending to use
 DiagonalCost since it'll give a more accurate heuristic distance.
-

- Rev 253 -
[2007/05/06] CR - Overview: Minor cleanup in some TCharacter Set* methods --
 documenting the routines, making parameters constant, and minimizing flags set
 for saving the Character State TCharacter.DataChanged isn't flagged when the
 value is identical to the Set* method's stored property value.
[2007/05/06] CR - Character - TCharacter.SetBAbyID, SetOnline, SetHomunID:
 Aforementioned changes above applied to these property writing routines.
-

- Rev 252-
[2007/05/04] - Tsusai - Notes/Overview: More tweaks to TWarpNPC & its lua side,
 and some documentation.
 New warp syntax, npc name is also the lua function name to call
  [hidden]warp("map","npc name and function name",x,y,xradius,yradius)
[2007/05/04] - Tsusai - Character - TCharacter: Clears personal thread on destroy.
[2007/05/04] - Tsusai - NPC - Added documentation, including a "tree" of how I
 plan the NPC object structure.
[2007/05/04] - Tsusai - NPC - TWarpNPC: Removed "Destination" values.  A warp 
 will be a ontouch activated lua script.  This will allow for random warps as
 well.  Removed static JID value.
[2007/05/04] - Tsusai - Map: Removed Lua from maps.
[2007/05/04] - Tsusai - GameConstants: Added NPC_WARPSPRITE & NPC_INVISIBLE 
 constants.
[2007/05/04] - Tsusai - LuaCoreRoutines: Documented Lua_isNonNumberString and
 added a "is not nil" check in TerminateLuaThread.
[2007/05/04] - Tsusai - LuaNPCCommands:  Added hiddenwarp support.  Broke up 
 the npc warp reading.  Now the syntax checker is its own procedure, and 
 addwarp and addhiddenwarp are designed to go through the checker and TWarpNPC
 maker.
[2007/05/04] - Tsusai - LuaNPCCore: Added comments.
-

- Rev 251 -
[2007/05/03] - Aeomin - Overview: Implement Whisper.
[2007/05/03] - Aeomin - Added RecvWhisperReply & RecvRedirectWhisper procedure [ZoneRecv.pas]
[2007/05/03] - Aeomin - Added RedirectWhisperToZone & SendWhisperReplyToInter procedure 
[ZoneInterCommunication.pas]
[2007/05/03] - Aeomin - Fixed type in Game database, lost '' in query 
[MySQLGameDatabase.pas(LoadChara)]
[2007/04/27] - Aeomin - Fixed typo header in Static database of JanSql

[2007/04/27] - Aeomin - Added SendWhisperReply procedure to tell client about result of whisper 
[ZoneSend.pas]
[2007/04/27] - Aeomin - Added SendWhisperReplyToZone procedure to parse the whisper reply code 
from Inter [ZoneInterCommunication.pas]
[2007/04/27] - Aeomin - Added RecvWhisper procedure to parse the request from zone [InterServer.pas]
[2007/04/27] - Aeomin - Added Whisper procedure to parse Whisper packet [ZoneRecv.pas]
[2007/04/27] - Aeomin - Added SendWhisperToInter procedure to send whisper request from zone to 
inter [ZoneInterCommunication.pas]
[2007/04/27] - Aeomin - Added 0x2210-0x2212 packet in packet_db.txt
-

- Rev 250 -
[2007/05/02] - Tsusai - Notes/Overview: Added basic TNPC structures and added the
 first REAL lua script function, warp(), which will load the parameters it has,
 and create a TWarpNPC.
 warp("new_1-1","Start-Castle",148,112,2,3,"new_1-2",100,9) is the syntax
 warp(map,name,x,y,xradius,yradius,destmap,destx,desty);
[2007/05/02] - Tsusai - NPC: Added, includes some basic TNPC structures, and
 descending classes such as TScriptNPC & TWarpNPC
[2007/05/02] - Tsusai - InterServer - TInterServer.RecvZoneWarpRequest: Changed
 the ZoneID check to check for > 0.
[2007/05/02] - Tsusai - LuaCoreRoutines: Added bool function Lua_isNonNumberString.
 A number like 345 passes the provided lua_isstring function, because it can be
 converted to a string.  This function checks if it is a string, then if that is
 not a number.  Good for alphanumeric strings only, no exceptions to pure numbers.
[2007/05/02] - Tsusai - LuaNPCCommands: Changed addwarp & addnpc lua commands to 
 npc and warp (still have add* prefix for the delphi procedure side).
[2007/05/02] - Tsusai - LuaNPCCommands - AddWarp: No longer a dummy procedure.
 This sucker error checks like MAD, makes a TWarpNPC if its ok, and adds it to
 the zone global list.
[2007/05/02] - Tsusai - LuaNPCCore: Splitted code from PrepLuaForNPCScripts to
 SetCharaIDToLua. Added GetCharaIDFromLua.
[2007/05/02] - Tsusai - ZoneServer: Added a NPCList (TIntList32) for storing NPCs.
 Added create & free methods as well.
-

- Rev 249 -
[2007/05/02] - RaX - Fixed packet_db, this corrects the freezing problem experienced
 in newer clients. (9/18+)
-

- Rev 248 -
[2007/05/01] - Tsusai - Notes/Overview: Fixed a warp error for same map or same
 zone.
[2007/05/01] - Tsusai - ZoneSend - ZoneSendWarp: Didn't save position for same map
 and same zone warping
-

- Rev 247 -
[2007/05/01] - Tsusai - Notes/Overview: Added RaX's warp code w/ some fixes.  Allows 
 for warping on the same map, same zone, and multi zone warping :)
[2007/05/01] - RaX - ServerInfo: const'd all strings that were not changing.
[2007/05/01] - RaX - InterServer: Added RecvZoneWarpRequest and 
 InterSendWarpReplyToZone.
[2007/05/01] - RaX - InterServer - TInterServer.ParseInterServ: Added reading of
 zone warping details (RecvZoneWarpRequest)
[2007/05/01] - Tsusai - InterServer - RecvZoneWarpRequest: Edited not to return
 any info if the zone w/ the request warp-to map doesn't exist.  They can walk
 to the magical unknown map for all I care.
[2007/05/01] - Tsusai - LoginServer - TLoginServer.Stop: Reversed the for loop of
 Charaserver deletions.
[2007/05/01] - Tsusai - LoginServer - RemoveFromAccountList: Commented out the
 Account Key nilling.  Fudges things up multi exe setups.
[2007/05/01] - RaX - ZoneRecv: Added RecvWarpRequestReplyFromInter.
[2007/05/01] - Tsusai - ZoneRecv - RecvWarpRequestReplyFromInter: Added updates
 to characters map and points, so after the d/c, it saves, and loads proper.
[2007/05/01] - RaX - ZoneSend: Added ZoneSendWarpRequest.
[2007/05/01] - Tsusai - ZoneSend: Added const to all procedures.
[2007/05/01] - RaX - ZoneServer - TZoneServer.InterReadClient: Added parsing
 for the warp request reply from interserver to pass to 
 RecvWarpRequestReplyFromInter.
-

- Rev 246 -
[2007/04/29] Tsusai - Notes/Overview: Walking mechanism revisited. Initial
 design modeled after prometheus highly inefficent.  It would cycle through all
 beings in a 33x33 area (16 radius, 1089 cells), as it cycled, it would go through
 all the beings for that cell to see if they were in the edge cells for showing
 and disappearing.  A new flow control was designed, reducing the number of cells
 checked down to approx 244 (down to 22% of original).
[2007/04/29] Tsusai - Being - TBeing.Walk: Broke up sections to HideBeings and
 ShowBeings.  Also redid the cell looping system to loop through a set of border
 cells (~244 for first/last two rows/columns) instead of 1089 cells.
[2007/04/29] Tsusai - Map - TMap: Removed any/all lua references
-

- Rev 245 -
[2007/04/29] RaX - Commented TMap.GetPath.
-

- Rev 244 -
[2007/04/29] CR - Overview: Cleanup of TCharacter.CalcMaxHP for clarity.
[2007/04/28] CR - Character: TCharacter.CalcMaxHP: Altered Comment Header, added
 further description of the routine.  Used an internal variable to simplify &
 shorten the span where the Database connection is open to retrieve the
 BaseMaxHP value.  Reindented the formula for initializing MaxHP.  Boy is it
 clearer to read without that long abomination of a method name to retrieve
 "GetBaseMaxHP"! :P~~
-

- Rev 243 -
[2007/04/28] CR - Overview: Made new data type in Being for stat arrays, used in
 both TBeing and TCharacter.  Cleanup in TCharacter.
[2007/04/28] CR - Being: New type ByteStatArray replaces the repeated use of
 array [STR..LUK] of Byte; definitions in Being and Character.
[2007/04/28] CR - Character: Reindented the data types above TCharacter.
[2007/04/28] CR - Character: TCharacter: Modified Class header.  Eliminated
 private section - all internal fields used for properties are now protected,
 instead.  Removed GetBaseStats property method (unneeded).  Altered
 SetBaseStats to model the changes I made in TBeing last commit.  Eliminated
 public variables that were IDENTICAL to those in TBeing (to avoid a repeat of
 problems like we had with fZeny in an earlier commit).  Changed ParamUP and
 ParamBonus so they use the ByteStatArray type like TBeing uses for ParamBase.
[2007/04/28] CR - Character: TCharacter:GetBaseStats: Removed.  This class will
 call the ancestor GetBaseStats instead, which is all that was done within this
 routine (I would've kept it if it had to alter DataChanged).
[2007/04/28] CR - Character: TCharacter:SetBaseStats: Altered Comment Header,
 improved description, noted Pre and Post conditions.  Altered parameters to
 match TBeing.
-

- Rev 242 - TYPOS IN REVISION ENTRY
[2007/04/28] CR - Overview: Commenting and headers added.  Minor changes made
 for improve efficiencies, and comments left where there might be room for
 further gains, once proper explanations are fleshed out.
[2007/04/28] CR - Being: Altered unit header.  Improved unit description.  Added
 class header for TBeing, described minor changes to the interface there.
[2007/04/28] CR - Being: TBeing: Altered header, included description.  Made
 empty routines CalcMaxHP and CalcMaxSP abstract.  Eliminated private section,
 moved AreaLoop into protected.
[2007/04/28] CR - Being: TBeing.Walk: Altered comment header.  Added scathing
 comments for the lack of explanation for what REALLY goes in within this
 routine when two of the devs working on this project had to deal with poorly
 documented code beforehand and SHOULD KNOW BETTER than to leave code of this
 complexity unadorned with ANY sensible comments.  On a positive note, the
 explanation for the routine was fine.
[2007/04/28] CR - Being: TBeing.Walk:GetDirection: Changed Index from Integer to
 Byte type to eliminate a cast.
[2007/04/28] CR - Being: TBeing.Create: Altered Comment Header.  Added comment
 regarding inherited behavior.
[2007/04/28] CR - Being: TBeing.Destroy: Altered header, added a better
 description.  Defined Pre and Post Conditons.  Added a comment stating that the
 inherited call must come last.  Bugfix: moved inherited call last so ancestor's
 cleanup happens after the EventList/Path are freed.
[2007/04/28] CR - Being: TBeing.SetName: Made Value parameter constant.
[2007/04/28] CR - Being: TBeing.GetBaseStats: Added Comment Header. Added
 precondition for Index range.
[2007/04/28] CR - Being: TBeing.SetBaseStats: Added Comment Header. Added
 precondition for Index range.
[2007/04/28] CR - Being: TBeing.CalcSpeed: Added comment header & description.
[2007/04/28] CR - Character: TCharacter.SetName: Made Value parameter constant
 to correspond with change made in TBeing.
-

- Rev 241 -
[2007/04/28] CR - Overview: Commenting, reuse of constants to self-explain an
 array's bounds.
[2007/04/28] CR - GameConstants: Altered header.  Rearranged Direction constants
 to reuse NORTH and NORTHEAST as the bounds for the constant Directions array.
-

 added.
[2007/04/25] Tsusai - LuaNPCCommands: Rearanged information.  Remembered I could use the

[2007/04/25] Tsusai - Notes/Overview: Lua Lua Lua Lua Lua Lua.
 Seriously, alot of restructuring of existing npc routines vs common lua routines.
[2007/04/25] Tsusai - LuaCoreRoutines: Added. I've split alot of crap out of the other units
 and made commands so that no other non Lua* unit calls the dll wrapper LuaPas itself. Added
 TLua, which is just the Plua_state, TLuaInfo, (for use w/ descendant threads like map and 
 character lua's) which stores a lua for itself, its own reference ID to the parent, and a
 link to the parent.  This is so that descendant execution threads can be unreferenced later
 and cleaned up on the fly :)
[2007/04/25] Tsusai - LuaNPC*: Renamed from NPCCore/Commands.  Redid and or rearranged the
 routines in these files with another or LuaCoreRoutines.
[2007/04/25] Tsusai - ZoneServer: Updated all lua calls because of the restructure.
[2007/04/25] Tsusai - Character: Lua (TLua) changed to LuaInfo (TLuaInfo).

 related calls for the above restructure.

[2007/04/24] Tsusai - Notes/Overview: Linux fix related to the GetTick function.
[2007/04/24] Tsusai - WinLinux - GetTick: The existing code only returned uptime in seconds.
 Unfortunatly in linux there is no current uptime in ms like Windows.  This fix stores a
 linux time at startup (seconds since 1900 and its ms), then will take the difference for
 the tick.

- Rev 236 -
[2007/04/23] Tsusai - Notes/Overview: Further refined lua in Helios.  Changed out once again
 the Delphi unit that controls the dll.  With that change, we can now use the latest Lua dll
 build 5.1.2.  Also corrected a tiny error with the linux compile line dealing with 
 LoginAccountInfo.  This was giving me phantom errors in the delphi environment.
[2007/04/23] Tsusai - Helios.dpr: Added the note that our license does not override third 
 party licensing.

[2007/04/16] Tsusai - Notes/Overview: Lua now integrated w/ Helios in a simple way.
 Units may need some cleanup, but when you run the zone, you will see results of loading
 test.lua (empty NPC Created reply & stored function execution).
[2007/04/16] Tsusai - Removed dynamic lua file that was added.  For some odd reason it
 wouldn't work proper.  Replaced with THLua units.

[2007/03/28] CR - Overview: Code cleanup in AreaLoopEvents, Being units.
[2007/03/28] CR - Version: updated version number, modified header comment.
[2007/03/28] CR - Being: Cleaned up uses clauses - unneeded units removed.
 Made changes to parameter lists for the TLoopCall declaration.  All 
 parameteters are constant, and eliminated the entirely uncalled X,Ys so that 
 we only have 2 parameters left (faster calls this way, especially when called 
 repeatedly in triple nested loops!).
[2007/03/28] CR - AreaLoopEvents: Cleaned up uses clauses - unneeded units
 removed, and some moved to local to the routines, not the declaration.  Made 
 changes to parameter lists for the routines here, following the new
 TLoopCall procedure declaration in Being.  All parameteters are constant, and 
 eliminated the entirely uncalled X,Ys so that we only have 2 parameters left.

 to occur...
[2007/03/26] RaX - Changed TThreadLink into a parent class with a TDatabase Databaselink as
 it's only property, it also has a constructor and destructor which create + free it.
[2007/03/26] RaX - The other links (CharaServerLink, ZoneServerLink) are descendants of
 TThreadLink as well as a new TClientLink which is what TThreadLink used to be.
[2007/03/26] RaX - Made each inherit the constructors, each also has a destructor which
 checks and frees the links of they're created.

- Rev 194 -
[2007/03/26] RaX - Notes/Overview : Fixed memory leaks in Account +  Character servers.
 Zone should be fine, we've kept strict control there by dealing with everything through
 an "owning" list.
 Just a note...We leaked in EVERY character server function...let's NOT let that happen
 ever again.
-

- Rev 193 -
[2007/03/25] RaX - Notes/Overview : Removed accountlist from globals. Modified code to 
 deal with it. Moved Account access into TThreadLink.AccountInfo for consistency.
[2007/03/25] RaX - Updated Globals.pas, removed all traces of the accountlist.
[2007/03/25] RaX - LoginServer.pas, killed accountlist, made account access local.
[2007/03/25] RaX - CharacterServer.pas killed accountlist. Made changes to offset
 the removal such as updating the account's charanum on create.

- Rev 192 -
[2007/03/15] Tsusai - Notes/Overview: Added 'Support_Dec06_AndNewerClients' to Character.ini
 This allows usage of ONLY December 2006 and newer clients when enabled.  kRO added the
 ability to rename a character, which at this time I do not know how to enable/support.
[2007/03/15] Tsusai - CharaOptions : Added [OPTIONS] 'Support_Dec06_AndNewerClients', and
 its parsing.
[2007/03/15] Tsusai - CharacterServer : Added WriteCharacterDataToBuffer.  This routine
 handles writing the character's stats to the outgoing buffer at the right offset.  Also
 this routine makes use of the new ini entry, so that the changed packet length is supported.
[2007/03/15] Tsusai - CharacterServer - CreateChara & SendCharas : Now call 
 WriteCharacterDataToBuffer.
-

- Rev 191 -
[2007/03/25] CR - Overview: Comments added to explain and state origins of
 WriteBufferTwoPoints
[2007/03/25] CR - BufferIO:WriteBufferTwoPoints - Added Comment Header, and 
 described routine in detail, and in summary.  Made remaining three passed 
 parameters constant.  Renamed local variables for more clarity:
[2007/03/25] CR - Version - updated version string (and version info for exe)
-

- Rev 190 -
[2007/03/25] CR - Overview: Bugfix - code meant to handle and notify user of
 malformed .pms mapfiles would not work as intended.  Result will NOT behave the
 same as C or C++'s return keyword!
[2007/03/25] CR - MapTypes - Added MAX_PMS_HEADER_LENGTH constant.  Used in
 TMapLoadFromFile
[2007/03/24] CR - Map:TMap.LoadFromFile - Parameter made constant (optimization)
 Renamed Parameter "Path" to "PmsFile" to avoid ambiguity with TMap.Path
 It's a more appropriate name than "Path" in the first place! :)
 Surrounded TMemoryStream with a try-finally to protect the resource.
 Fixed major logic flaws -- Result is NOT handled like C/C++'s "return"
 keyword.  Thus, we NEED to use if-then-else branching, not just sequential
 if-thens.  Malformed/hand-mangled maps could cause fatal errors with the old
 code flow, because it couldn't avoid continuing on instead of bailing early.
[2007/03/25] CR - Helios.dpr - removed MadShi units that were added in on
 Aeomin's previous build.
[2007/03/25] CR - Version - Updated text displayable version (and the build 
 number that's stored in the exe itself too).
-

[2007/03/24] - Aeomin - Added IgnoreMob & IgnoreNPC parameter to TBeing.AreaLoop to extend for
 future NPCs (Mob also is NPC) [Being.pas]
[2007/03/24] - Aeomin - Extended TBeing.Walk to handle NPC/Mob and etc... [Being.pas]
[2007/03/24] - Aeomin - Renamed ZoneWalkingChar to ZoneWalkingBeing, ZoneSendChar to ZoneSendBeing,
 ZoneDisappearChar to ZoneDisappearBeing, to support other than character (Npc,Mob etc) [ZoneSend.pas]
[2007/03/23] - Aeomin - More typo fixes on direction
-

- Rev 188 -
[2007/03/24] CR - Overview: Hint Removal, Refactor, Credits.
 Removed a warning for an unused local variable in TCharacter.SendSubStat.
[2007/03/24] CR - Character:TCharacter.SendSubStat - Moved first section of
 this routine into local procedure Send_00b0.  Moved the non-implemented blocks
 into local routines as well.  Made all parameters constant, which self-
 documents these, and makes calling the routine more efficient.   Anyone
 working on this routine, please feel free to use more descriptive or
 appropriate local routine names! :)
[2007/03/24] CR - Updated Contributors on this document and Helios.dpr

[2007/03/16] - Tsusai - Notes/Overview: Fixed the character point "not saving".
[2007/03/16] - Tsusai - Map - GetPath: Commented out the use of APath.Assign.  The list that
 was copied was ordered in reverse (destination at index 0, source at last index).  Since
 the list was passed that way, it was thinking that we started at the end and went to where
 we were.  Currently uses a for downto loop to copy the points just right.
[2007/03/16] - Tsusai - Character - TCharacter: Removed 'inherited' calls on the Save Map

 that allows you to convert a direction constant number IE::0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 into a point
 and vice versa.
[2007/03/14] - RaX - Moved Direction constant array from Map.pas into game constants.
[2007/03/14] - RaX - Added direction constants to game constants (North, south, etc).
[2007/03/14] - RaX - Renamed Bidx in TBeing.Walk to BeingIndex, was hard to understand.
[2007/03/14] - RaX - Renamed TBeing.Point to Position, was hiding the Point method in Types.

 results, etc.).
[2007/02/26] - RaX - Implemented MS_ALERT type messages in Commands.
[2007/02/26] - RaX - Fixed bug with /exit command, Helios would not exit cleanly because

 new command, /credits, displays them.
-

- Rev 157 -
[2007/02/24] - RaX - Overview : Finished log configuration by adding the ability to set
 which types of messages are logged. Added ability to configure which directories are used
 (Maps/Database/Configuration Directories). Made all ini files create in the configuration
 directory set in Helios.ini, which now retains the name of the .exe so, in effect, an
 administrator could run multiple exe's in one folder by setting the folder names difrerently.
[2007/02/24] - RaX - Reorganized MainProc.Startup, moved Header into DisplayHeader.

 and not crash.
[2007/02/25] - RaX - Removed a debug line I had forgotten about in Map.pas.
[2007/02/25] - RaX - Console was being free'd in Destroy Globals, so when an administrator

[2007/02/20] - RaX - Unfortunately, because of my brain at 3am, I forgot to commit main.pas
 so rev 148 is broken. Sorry =(.
[2007/02/20] - RaX - Changed Error colors to red instead of burgundy.
-

- Rev 148 - BROKEN
[2007/02/20] - RaX - Fixed termination. Helios now checks to see if it is done loading
 before a user can shut it down. If an administrator attempts to shut it down, it will write
 a message informing the administrator that he/she must wait until helios is done starting
 before he/she can stop it.
-

- Rev 147 -
[2007/02/20] - RaX - Implemented typed console messages. Each displays differently
 automagically in the console based on a constant passed to the Console.Message routine.
[2007/02/20] - RaX - Console is now a global rather than being attached to mainproc.

 and LongWord as the return type.
-

- Rev 142 -
[2007/02/09] - Tsusai - Notes/Overview: After some reading of newsgroups, I learned that
 the Cardinal type (0..4bil number type) is 4 bytes..but its not guaranteed on all OS's and
 versions of Delphi.  All Cardinals are now LongWords, which are always going to be 4 bytes,
 and covers the same number range.
-

- Rev 141 -
[2007/01/31] - RaX - Added comment headers to event related units. Reorganized the

 it to skip events. Fixed.
-

- Rev 136 -
[2007/01/26] - RaX - Moved CharacterEventThread from Console to ZoneServer.
-

- Rev 135 -

[2007/01/26] - RaX -Added Event, EventList, MovementEvent, and CharacterEventThread into 
 Classes/Events/.
[2007/01/26] - RaX - Added ZoneServer.OnDisconnect, it free's characters from it's list.
-

- Rev 134 -
[2007/01/26] - RaX - Removed Global Character List. Now, only the zone server has a list.
 Character Server only uses queries.
[2007/01/26] - RaX - Modified LoadChara to calculate max hp/sp, speed, and weight.
-

- Rev 133 -
[2007/01/25] - RaX - Updated Map Load, made all maps load on startup, but Cell information
 load dynamically. Nothing unloads...yet...will do once I finish the event system.
[2007/01/25] - RaX - Moved Cell Loading portion of TMap.LoadFromFile into TMap.Load.
[2007/01/25] - RaX - Added TMap.Unload, which destroys a map's Cell information.
[2007/01/25] - RaX - Updated Pathing code a little bit, made to be slightly more efficient
 by not using Length() to get Y and XMax variables twice, I have them returned via var
 parameters in GetArea.
[2007/01/25] - RaX - Moved ZoneServer CommClient connection stuff into 
 TZoneServer.ConnectToCharacter, implemented AFTER startup to make things look nice.

-

- Rev 132 -
[2007/01/25] - Tsusai - Notes/Overview: Cleaned up RaX's replace code, and added a
 ExtractFileNameMod to WinLinux to take care of it.
[2007/01/25] - Tsusai - Map - LoadFromFile: Replaced RaX's code to call ExtractFileNameMod
[2007/01/25] - Tsusai - WinLinux - ExtractFileNameMod: Added.  The real ExtractFileName
 uses a delimiter to do the work (\).  Our cross compiling code for paths use / so it would
 never break it up.  This new function acts as a middle man, converting all / to \ in a
 Windows Only environment before making the actual ExtractFileName call.
[2007/01/25] - Tsusai - Being - TBeing: Added the common attributes between Characters and
 Mobs, such as MDEF.  Unlike Prometheus, I think we can live with putting mob info into MDEF1
 and not worry about reading/writing to MDEF2 (the + bonus).
[2007/01/25] - Tsusai - Character - TCharacter: Removed most of the common things descending
 from TBeing, and rearanged properties so that I could turn the "This method hides * in base
 class" warnings by a compiler directive.
[2007/01/25] - Tsusai - GameConstants: STR..LUK are now 0..5 instead of 1..6  Its murder on
 me to remember and for packet writing (especially when it'll be shared w/ mobs).
-

- Rev 131 -
[2007/01/24] - RaX - Notes/Overview - Bugfixes. ExtractFileName doesn't like forward slashes
 like what we use in TMap.LoadFromFile. Had to write a very inefficient way to recreate
 that. Luckily, now we can handle any slashes in a file path, even if the os can't...
 Bugfix #2 - I forgot to remove the .gat searching in the static database queries.
-

- Rev 130 -
[2007/01/24] - RaX - Notes/Overview - Implemented weight table and MaxWeight TCharacter
 calculations.

[2007/01/24] - RaX - Updated hp/sp tables to include baby jobs and super novice.
-

- Rev 129 -
[2007/01/24] - RaX - Added another optimization that was supposed to be in the last commit.
 TMap.LoadFromFile(Map.pas) changed MapTag from a string to an array[1..13] of char to
 avoid a needless setlength call before reading in the maptag from the mapfile.
-

- Rev 128 -
[2007/01/23] - RaX - Notes/Overview - Optimizations suggested by Damian (Thanks again).
[2007/01/23] - RaX - Updated CharaServer/LoginServer to make sure that the charaserverinfo/
 zoneserverinfo lists get their information free'd on stopping the servers.
[2007/01/23] - RaX - Updated BufferReadString(BufferIO.pas) to hopefully be slightly faster
 if not just more readable and not dependant on TCBuffer.
[2007/01/23] - RaX - Changed TCell (MapTypes.pas) to use on Being list instead of 3 lists.
[2007/01/23] - RaX - Renamed Graph to Cell in the comments in Map.pas, forgot to when I made
 the earlier changes (sorry!)
-

- Rev 127 -
[2007/01/23] - RaX - Forgot to Free the maplist in ZoneServer.Destroy (Thanks Damian),

[2007/01/22] - RaX - Updated Static maps table, removed '.gat' from the mapname field.
[2007/01/22] - RaX - LoginServer, CharacterServer, ZoneServer, InterServer - added console
 messages if someone tries to start a server that's already started, etc from inside code.

 start routines.
[2007/01/22] - RaX - Removed InterToZoneClient from inter server, won't be needing it.

 priority (will be testing Libc.nice soon)
[2007/01/21] - Tsusai - XTimer : Updated priority call (LowerPriority);

 create/destroy.
-

- Rev 121 -
[2007/01/20] - Tsusai - Notes/Overview: Something isn't right when either packet_db or the
 databases fail to load/connect and the server says Startup Success.....bullshit.
[2007/01/20] - Tsusai - PacketDB - LoadPacketDB: Now a function, if it fails to load, its
 false. (duh)
[2007/01/20] - Tsusai - ALLDATABASES : Create holds a result bool variable, which is set
 by the Connect function (if connected, true)

 all 3 databases were created and connected.
[2007/01/20] - Tsusai - Globals - InitGlobals: Now a function, returns true if packetdb 
 and database loaded. (notice a pattern in the changelog yet?)

[2007/01/20] - Tsusai - Found a shortcut method IdContext.Binding, which
 links to Idcontext.Connection.Socket.Binding.  Any use of the long version has been
 replaced with the shortcut, and any Console messages that broke word wrap limit have been
 wrapped.  Changes are in:
 -LoginServer 
 -CharacterServer
 -ZoneServer
[2007/01/20] - Tsusai - CharacterServer - In the ZServerInfo.Address call, there was a spare
 ',' that I overlooked.  Delphi ignores it, but Kylix caught it.  Fixed
[2007/01/20] - Tsusai - CommClient - Replaced TThread and now useing TIdThread.  It has
 reduced some conflicts when trying to access the client readthreads.
-

 and corrected queries.
[2007/01/17] - Tsusai - Character - TCharacter : Added a basic client packet subsystem.  It 
 may not be the best place for it, but for now it is ok.
[2007/01/17] - Tsusai - BufferIO - RecvBuffer : Cannot recieve 0 packets. The system 
 doesn't like it.
[2007/01/17] - Tsusai - GameConstants : Removed invalid job classes (stupid data I put in)

[2007/01/14] - Tsusai - TCPServerRoutines - Updated the CommClient creation for the above
 update.
[2007/01/14] - Tsusai - ZoneOptions - Added missing entries, such as CharaServer location

 updated SendCharaToMap to take on a connection and buffer parameter, Corrected error constant
 numbers (was getting email error where could not happen error should be, and vice versa.

[2007/01/12] - Tsusai - Notes/Overview: Fixed the outstanding JanSQL character server table
 errors.  We were trying to save and release a table that was already released due to 
 LoadChara releasing.
[2007/01/12] - Tsusai - JanSQLGameDatabase - Overrode the GetChara procedure.  Now takes a
 flag to release the table after loading of a character. LoadChara NO LONGER releases the
 table, since GetChara is the only thing that calls it and takes care of it if it needs to.
[2007/01/12] - Tsusai - LoginServer - Fixed my January 2006 entries...its 2007 now.
-

[2007/01/08] - Tsusai - Notes/Overview: Modifications to allow WAN/LAN checking complete
 and in place.
[2007/01/08] - Tsusai - WinLinux: Added a record type called TIPSet, which contains 2 strings,
 Full, and Partial.  This is to store more things for the result type of 
 GetIPStringFromHostname.
[2007/01/08] - Tsusai - WinLinux - GetIPStringFromHostname: Now returns a TIPSet type, 
 the Full IP that is obtained and a Partial (X.X.X.) The last . is for prevention of comparing
 192.168.10.1 to the partial of 192.168.1
[2007/01/08] - Tsusai - Inter/Zone servers: Disabled IP and IPCardinal code.  Will reactivate
 properly later.
[2007/01/08] - Tsusai - CharaServerInfo: Overhauled ip / port information. changed the storage
 strings that would store pure IPs as what they originally are, instead of parsing the IPs
 from a hostname for example.  WANPort -> Port.  Added fLANPartial to store the partial LAN
 IP.  Added Function Address, which takes a IP string of the client, for checking against 
 the LAN IP Partial that is stored.
[2007/01/08] - Tsusai - LoginServer - SendCharacterServers: Changed the WANCardinal and
 placed the Address() function in it is placed.
[2007/01/08] - Tsusai - LoginServer - VerifyCharaServer: Changed the WANPort to Port.

[2007/01/08] - Tsusai - Notes/Overview: Fixed JanSQL Queries, and a tweak to janSQL and 
 CommClient.
[2007/01/08] - Tsusai - CommClient: Once again reorganized order of procedures when relating
 to disconnecting and suspending the client thread.
[2007/01/08] - Tsusai - janSQL: Modified anything relating to file I/O to use / in the path,
 instead of \ due to linux issues.
[2007/01/08] - Tsusai - JanSQLDatabase: Updated any missing %s strings to have quotes
 surrounding, janSQL doesn't like them too much and goofs w/o errors.

[2007/01/07] - RaX - Added public property, Options, to each server. Options is the ini for
 each.
[2007/01/07] - RaX - Added Options to MainProc and Database.
[2007/01/07] - RaX - Changed Database class system so that each Database Template Child is
 created with a parent argument, allowing Options to be called from inside the child classes
 rather than having to have it passed into it.
[2007/01/07] - RaX - Cleaned up unused variables in ZoneServer.
[2007/01/07] - RaX - Re-organized uses in Helios.dpr to be organized first by category, and
 then alphabetically for better classification.
[2007/01/07] - RaX - Added more inter communication variables to ZoneServer, in preparation
 for zone->chara and zone->inter communication.

- Rev 96 -
[2007/01/04] - RaX - Added Headers to CommClient and updated Globals'.
[2007/01/04] - RaX - Changed server.start routines to use a hidden parameter, reload, which
 tells it whether to reload the ini or not.
[2007/01/04] - RaX - Added and implemented Globals - LoadIni; for the above change. LoadIni
 Free's ServerConfig if it's assigned, and recreates it.
-

- Rev 95 -
[2007/01/04] - Tsusai - Reorganized the suspending code of the CommClient thread. 
 Apparently it would halt the thread (good) but not disconnect (bad).

[2007/01/03] - Tsusai - Notes/Overview : Implemented the GetPacketLength function, and added
 some new console output messages to let admins know what is going on with login and character
 servers.
[2007/01/03] - Tsusai - DatabaseTXT: Allowed Load_PacketDB be called outside of that unit.
[2007/01/03] - Tsusai - Added the following files into Notes: client_packet_en (from
 prometheus), and Generating Linux Compiles.txt
[2007/01/03] - Tsusai - Database\packet_db.txt - Added Helios custom packets (server
 communication packets).
[2007/01/03] - Tsusai - Globals - InitGlobals:  Calls Load_PacketDB.

 DeactivateServer calls.
[2007/01/03] - Tsusai - Console : Added a blank space after the server startup.

 lengths (Recv and Send) with the GetPacketLength function.
-

- Rev 92 -
[2007/01/03] - RaX - Added 2 ini entries, [Login] - Key and [Chara] - LoginKey. Now we can
 specify the password used to communicate between the login and character servers.
-

- Rev 91 -
[2007/01/02] - RaX - Thanks to research done by Tsusai, our text database works with
 multiple exes.
[2007/01/02] - RaX - Changed JanSQLDatabase to save and release after each update/insert/
 delete and just release after each select, this causes the text database to reload itself
 before queries, allowing real-time data changes in a text database =o.
-

- Rev 90 -
[2006/12/30] - RaX - Pretty much redid the database reorganization of the last commit.
 Moved Databases to be a private entity of each server. Zone is the exception, multiple
 file rely on the zone's database since we don't want the zone server file to be, well,
 HUGE =)

	NOTE::: The 12/28 client works, but is quirky. There seems to be some missing
 		padding in create character and delete character, because results for each
		are random. Tsusai, can you sniff the exe and see what's missing? Maybe
		it'll be a simple feature to add. I'll e-mail it to you par request.

- Rev 89 -
[2006/12/29] - RaX - Added my e-mail address to the helios.dpr header.
[2006/12/29] - RaX - Moved Database creates and frees around to assign each dynamically
 based on which servers are enabled.
[2006/12/29] - RaX - Added new console commands, start and stop. For example, /start login
 would create and start the login server. /stop login would stop and free the login server.

- Rev 88 -
[2006/12/28] - Tsusai - Forgot to put back the Account field in the LoadChara in both existing
 database calls.

[2006/12/27] - Tsusai - Notes/Overview: More updates to the multi character server coding,
 mainly side effect bugfixes.
[2006/12/27] - Tsusai - Account - GetBanned and GetConnectTime: Removed the SQL calls,
 and simplied.
[2006/12/27] - Tsusai - CommClient - TClientThread.Execute: tweaked the try/except field.
[2006/12/27] - Tsusai - MySQLDatabase, JanSQLDatabase, DatabaseTemplate: Changed
 GetAccountBanAndConnectTime to RefreshAccountData.
[2006/12/27] - Tsusai - MySQLDatabase, JanSQLDatabase : Fixed GenderChar and LoginKey
 reading in SetAccount, modified GetAccount (both types) to be more efficient, and
 read the new RefreshAccountData that is required. RefreshAccountData reads the ban and
 connect (play) time, and the login keys.

- Rev 85 -
[2006/12/26] - RaX - Oops, forgot to remove some code from a previous method of getting a
 new character's id in JanSQLDatabase. CreateChara.
-

- Rev 84 -
[2006/12/24] - RaX - Added default values to TCharacters in CreateChara(CharacterServer).
-

- Rev 83 -
[2006/12/24] - Tsusai - Notes/Overview: Unfortnately a large commit.  This commit includes
 the ability to finally start linking 2 exes together, at the characterserver level.  Thats
 right, running two copies correctly, can result in having two servers listed at the server
 selection menu after login.  Also many Uses have been cleaned up.
[2006/12/24] - Tsusai - Added the following units: CharacterServerInfo, CharaLoginPackets,
 and CommClient.
[2006/12/24] - Tsusai - CharacterServerInfo : Contains a type that houses information on a
 Character Server, such as WAN/LAN IPs, port, Servername, and online users.  These are stored
 in a list that is read from when someone logs in, and is sent a list.
[2006/12/24] - Tsusai - CharaLoginPackets : Contain all Outgoing routines at the moment.
[2006/12/24] - Tsusai - CommClient : Contains a Indy TCP Client descendant, which controls
 a generated thread.  The thread checks for connection and tries to connect every 30 seconds.
 It also figures out if there is data available and passes it on as a OnRecieve event.
[2006/12/24] - Tsusai - InterServer, ZoneServer : Turned off their built in clients for now.
[2006/12/24] - Tsusai - Console : Removed static list entry for the character servers 
 (our workaround until this was done).
[2006/12/24] - Tsusai - TCPServerRoutines (NEEDS RENAMING NOW) : Replaced all TIdTCPClients
 with TInterClient, and updated Activate/Deactivate Client as needed.  Also removed crap out
 of DeactivateServer for now.  I think we won't suffer that problem we did in Prometheus.
[2006/12/24] - Tsusai - PacketTypes : Added TCharaServerLink type which is used in LoginServer.
[2006/12/24] - Tsusai - Globals : Removed UTF8String (its still just string), Cleaned up uses,
 removed CharacterServerList (now private in LoginServer as it should be). Added IncMinute and
 IncSecond routines.
[2006/12/24] - Tsusai - BufferIO : Added WriteBufferMD5String to write the bytes as they are
 into buffer, and ReadBufferMD5 to read the bytes directly from the buffer.  Overloaded
 SendBuffer and RecvBuffer to accept TInterClient as a passed parameter.  Fixed
 BufferReadString's parameters.
[2006/12/24] - Tsusai - mwStringHashList : Fixed Uses.
[2006/12/24] - Tsusai - Character - SetSaveTime: Uses IncMinute from Globals now.
[2006/12/24] - Tsusai - LoginServer - Cleaned uses, Removed OnExecute Event, tied
 ParseLoginServer directly to it.  Added OnDiscconect method, to remove character server 
 information from the list if that particular client disconnected. CharaServerList has been
 moved here and is a private field. Removed ReadMD5Password (in BufferIO now).  Updated
 parameters of ValidateLogin and SendLoginError. Added VerifyCharaServer to validate
 (static validate for now).  Fixed the packet indexes and loop for SendCharacterServers.
 Added Parsing of charaserv client packets to ParseLogin.  Will be fined tuned in a later
 commit.
[2006/12/24] - Tsusai - CharacterServer : Removed anything having to do with the translation
 of IP/Hostname strings into cardinals. Added CharaToLoginClient, and events for it (OnConnected
 and OnRecieve). Removed CharacterServer.OnExecute, using ParseCharaServ directly. Added the 
 setting of Host/Port of the CharaToLoginClient in .Start for now.  Also removed the While
 from ParseCharaServer, not needed.
[2006/12/24] - Tsusai - Added Packet documentation for Chara<->login communications to Notes
[2006/12/24] - Tsusai - Removed Subdirectories in obj, not needed.

[2006/12/23] - RaX - Notes/Overview - Implemented new FASTER character list and fixed a bug
 in JanSQLDatabase.
[2006/12/23] - RaX - Added CharaList.pas, a low level TCharacterList which is as fast as it
 gets I believe.
[2006/12/23] - RaX - Updated CharaExists both overloads in JanSQLDatabase.pas. Both weren't
 looking at the record count, only at the result identifier, and if there are records to be
 found, Jan returns an identifier, which is why it worked with no characters in the
 database =)
[2006/12/23] - RaX - Changed Globals to use a TCharacterList instead of a TIntList32 as the
 global characterlist.
[2006/12/23] - RaX - Changed CharacterServer to use the new characterlist.
[2006/12/23] - RaX - Changed JanSQL + MySQL + DatabaseTemplate to use the new list.

- Rev 76-
[2006/12/21] - RaX - Fixed CharacterList Corruption bug. We were free'ing ACharacter after
 it was already free'd in CharacterList.Delete which caused a crash.(JanSQLDatabase,
 MySQLDatabase)
-

- Rev 75-
[2006/12/21] - RaX - Removed Deprecated units AccountDB, SQL, and SaveThread. Leaving
 XTimer in case we need a timer.

[2006/12/21] - RaX - Updated JanSQLDatabase queries to work with jansql. (JanSQLDatabase)
[2006/12/21] - RaX - Changed StrToInt to StrToIntDef with a default of 0 in LoadChara
 because JanSQL doesn't support default values or typing for that matter.
[2006/12/21] - RaX - Added calculations for the next available ID to CreateChara, see above
 for details as to why.
-

- Rev 73-
[2006/12/21] - Tsusai - Notes/Overview: Renamed unit Socket to BufferIO.  All applicable 
 files were updated.
-

- Rev 72-
[2006/12/21] - RaX - Modified JanSQLDatabase.pas to use resultidentifier numbers to access
 the internal list of recordsets rather than using passed QueryResult pointers. Freeing
 these was causing JanSQL to corrupt it's internal list and cause random crashes. Also,
 the result list would get unbearably huge after a short time =) from now on we use
 Database.ReleaseRecordset(ResultIdentifier : Integer) to free our query results in jan.
[2006/12/21] - RaX - Modified MySQLDatabase and JanSQLDatabase in GetBanAndConnect to use
 special queries rather than just reloading the entire account.
[2006/12/21] - RaX - changed serveroptions.ini to have the default database host as ./save
 to allow jansql to work out of the box.
[2006/12/21] - RaX - added jansql database to the save folder in trunk/bin.
-

- Rev 71-
[2006/12/20] - Tsusai - Notes/Overview: Updates to database system.
[2006/12/20] - Tsusai - DatabaseTemplate: Modified CONNECT to use out current standard
 parameters, instead of using reintroduces and overrides in the children classes.
[2006/12/20] - Tsusai - MySQLDatabase & JanSQLDatabase - SaveAccount: Removed StrToInt64
 conversions of dates.  Just strings now.
[2006/12/20] - Tsusai - JanSQLDatabase - SaveAccount: Fixed how the dates are stored back
 into the database. This caused problems of the same account trying to reconnect, and bad
 times being read when logging BACK in.
[2006/12/20] - Tsusai - JanSQLDatabase: Added Disconnect method, which calls the commit
 query to save the database.
-

[2006/12/19] - Tsusai - Accounts: For some reason if a person attempted to login with the mf 
 suffix for auto account creation on MD5 connection, following connections would be told
 they have no more game time. The Now procedure was somehow not returning, but with
 SysUtils.Now as the replacement, it works.  Not too sure if something is causing a conflict
 with it, but it should be sound now.

 Added missing memory free'ing of QueryResults.
[2006/12/18] - Tsusai - JanSQLDatabase - SendQuery : If locating a row failed, and returned
 nothing (it happens), it would return a nil set.  Works now by creating one prior to setting.
 Not too sure this is proper.
[2006/12/18] - Tsusai - janSQLTokenizer: Restored to pre cleaning.  Something I did made it
 malfunction on connecting.
[2006/12/18] - Tsusai - Globals : Readded optional INI loading.

 database connections, instead of creating on the fly.
[2006/12/17] - Tsusai - MySQLDatabaseTemplate : Corrected queries.  One error was trying to

 ERangeError, because of 0 characters being returned.  Also fixed a database call that was
 calling the wrong database (was trying to do a query in the common database, and not in 
 the game database).
[2006/11/14] - Tsusai - Account - TAccount : Added a ConnectUntil datetime field, updated
 Banned to a datetime.  Added various methods and functions to make checking these easier.
[2006/11/14] - Tsusai - Database - Removed all Writeln and replaced with MainProc.Console
[2006/11/14] - Tsusai - DatabaseTemplate/MySQLDatabase - GetAccountBanAndConnectTime : Added.
[2006/11/14] - Tsusai - MySQLDatabase - All query statements updated to table restructures.
[2006/11/14] - Tsusai - Globals - Added ConvertMySQLTime to convert the time string from
 MySQL to a TDateTime.  If given a 0000-00-00 00:00:00 (which is impossible to convert), it
 uses the lowest possible TDateTime (like january 1900).
[2006/11/14] - Tsusai - ServerOptions - Updated default Database names.
[2006/11/14] - Tsusai - LoginProcesses - Replaced Writeln, and added banned and connectuntil
 checks with properly added response codes.

 works proper.
[2006/11/13] - Tsusai - DatabaseTemplate - Reindented.
[2006/11/13] - Tsusai - Database - TDatabase.Create : Now gets an optional parameter, to

[2006/11/13] - Tsusai - CharaServerProcesses - Updated any TDatabase creations to make sure
 the right database is accessed.
[2006/11/13] - Tsusai - MySQLDatabase - TMySQLDatabase : Placed "Connection" into private,

[2006/11/12] - Tsusai - CharaServerProcess - ParseCharaServ : Removed TThreadLink variable,
 not needed.
[2006/11/12] - Tsusai - WinLinux : Added a PriorityLow global constant.  Windows has tpLowest

 is now Database (case issue) and the \ in the path is now a / (pathing issue).
-

- Rev 48-
[2006/11/11] - Tsusai - BUGFIX (God I did not want to see one of these...).  Removed the
 usage of FreeAndNil(ADatabase); that RaX implemented.  Replaced with ADatabase.Free;  Odd
 thing was that once a person logged into character server, it would no longer accept any
 more connections.
[2006/11/11] - Tsusai - ZoneCore & Console - Reindented.
[2006/11/11] - Tsusai - Globals - MakeRNDString added, generates a random string based on

 client info, and stored the randomly generated key in it (ONLY WHEN MD5 CONNECTIONS ARE USED)
-

- Rev 47-
[2006/11/06] - Tsusai - Merged GameGlobals into GameConstants, and updated any/all units
 that used to call GameGlobals.
 out a better timer, so for now, we have seconds.
[2006/11/06] - Tsusai - Updated 3rdParty.txt to mention we are using uMySQL** under MySQL's
 FLOSS exception.
[2006/11/06] - Tsusai - Extracted the version string to its own unit, to keep revisions to
 Globals separate.
-

- Rev 46-
[2006/11/03] - RaX - Rewrote XTimer to fix problems with processors that modulate their
 clock speed. Changed resolution to seconds. We can't have lower resolutions until I figure
 out a better timer, so for now, we have seconds.
[2006/11/03] - RaX - Changed ini loading to load default 60 for SaveTimer.Interval.
[2006/11/03] - RaX - Changed Console.Pas to accomodate our new changes.
-

- Rev 45-
[2006/11/02] - RaX - Updated ThirdParty.txt to include Indy. Also, corrected mistakes made
 by yours truly in the umysqlclient credits. "There is no Spoof", you could say. Updated to
 "Part 10" of the GNU license.
-

- Rev 44-
[2006/11/01] - RaX - Map.pas - Implemented Tsusai's changed to GetPath which include, but
 are not limited to, the following...
	GetPath changed to a boolean function with APath as a parameter passed by address.
	Addition of IsBlocked to check for passability versus a multi-line condition.
[2006/11/01] - RaX - Map.pas - Added GetArea, a private method of TMap which creates a
 search area based on our constant CHAR_CLICKAREA distance away from the starting point.
[2006/11/02] - RaX - moved CHAR_CLICKAREA into Constants/GameConstants.pas.
[2006/11/02] - RaX - Added GameConstants.pas.
-

- Rev 43-
[2006/10/31] - RaX - Modified Map.pas - GetPath to return a TPointList instead of an Array
[2006/10/31] - RaX - moved constant CHAR_CLICKAREA to implementation,
 created Directions constant array of tpoints which contains the distance to go from the
 starting point to get the point in said direction.
[2006/10/31] - RaX - changed TMap.Graph to an array of array of TPoint.
-

- Rev 42-
[2006/10/30] - RaX - Added Classes/Map.Pas - our TMap map class. Stubbed, only contains our
 pathfinding algorithm for now. The Pathfinder is a "floodfill" or "wave" search that finds
 the shortest path between 2 points by flooding the graph with tracers that keep track of
 where they've been. The first one to reach the end's path is the shortest path.
-

- Rev 41-
[2006/10/23] - RaX - Random cleanup in LoginProcess, removed unused variables and function
 calls from our former Indy9 socket.
-

- Rev 40-
[2006/10/23] - RaX - Updated XTimer to have a Resolution property which is defined by constants
 to reflect the accuracy fo the timer, between nanoseconds and seconds. XTimer is now much
 more accurate than before as well.
[2006/10/23] - RaX - Added variables to ServerConfig to enable/disable and set the interval
 for the Save Loop.
-

- Rev 39-
[2006/10/21] - RaX - Re-Added XTimer.pas (it works correctly now, and better!) changed over
 SaveLoop.pas into what it was supposed to be, the save thread only, executed by XTimer.
 XTimer is now a reuseable timer with a real resolution of 1ms ...the defining element is
 assembly....go me. Will be updated to really get accurate time down to the clock speed of
 the processor (faster the clock speed, the more accurate the timer).
[2006/10/21] - RaX - Added our license to the header of Helios.dpr.
[2006/10/21] - RaX - Added ThirdParty.txt contents. Basic, but effective.
-

- Rev 38-
[2006/10/20] - Tsusai - Upgraded things to Indy 10. All old outstanding writebuffers now use
 Socket.SendBuffer.
[2006/10/20] - Tsusai - Console: Updated all TIdPeerThreads to TIdContext, and renamed
 AThread to AConnection.
[2006/10/20] - Tsusai - Socket: Updated SendPading to use SendBuffer.  SendBuffer now
 converts OUR buffer to Indy bytebits to send out (it took 3 hours to get sending to work
 right).  Also added a RecvBuffer, to handle recieving packets and putting them into a buffer.
[2006/10/20] - Tsusai - TCPServerRoutines: Updated threads to contexts in DeactivateServer.
[2006/10/20] - Tsusai - Login/Zone/Chara : Updated all peerthreads to contexts, removed
 ReadFromStack, redid the input buffer size call, and implemented SendBuffer (if missing)
 and RecvBuffer.
-

- Rev 37-
[2006/10/13] - Tsusai - Friday October 13th....Just as creepy as 06/06/06
[2006/10/13] - Tsusai - LoginProcesses: Separated the validation code from ParseLogin, and
 added MD5 client connection support.
-

- Rev 36-
[2006/10/10] - RaX - Code cleanup...
[2006/10/10] - RaX - moved Run from Helios.dpr to MainProc as a property for organization.
[2006/10/10] - RaX - Moved around save loop creates and destroys around in MainProc to make
 it force a save before the loop shuts down and free and recreate on restart.
[2006/10/10] - RaX - Added TSaveLoop.Save which will house the actual save code... to allow
 forcing a full save by simply calling this procedure from outside the thread.
-

- Rev 35-
[2006/10/09] - RaX - Fixed my timer. It wasn't allowing console commands (for some unknown
 reason). Removed XTimer, moved everything into SaveLoop...no more Enabled Property.
 {Thank you Tsusai}
-

- Rev 34-
[2006/10/06] - RaX - Updated XTimer.pas to work with Delphi 7 (Self.Ontimer(); vs OnTimer());
-

- Rev 33-
[2006/10/06] - RaX - Overview - stubbed out the save loop thread routines and built a timer
 for us to use.
[2006/10/06] - RaX - FIXED - Added CharaList.pas - forgot to last commit (sorry).
[2006/10/06] - RaX - Added SaveTimer to MainProc, a threaded Timer I wrote.
[2006/10/06] - RaX - Added TXTimer (Classes/XTimer.pas), a timer thread meant for the save.
 loop.
[2006/10/06] - RaX - Added TSaveLoop(Classes/SaveLoop.pas) - our Saving thread.
[2006/10/06] - RaX - How it works - The Timer runs in background forever. At Interval ms,
 it executes the saveloop, which runs outside of the execution path of both MainProc, and
 the timer itself. After saving, the SaveLoop automatically free's itself.
-

- Rev 32- BROKEN
[2006/10/06] - RaX - Finished implementation of the Database system and made it thread-safe
 (we now use a local, to the object instance, connection rather than the old global one.)
[2006/10/06] - RaX - CharaServerProcess - ripped out lingering sql queries and moved them 
 into the databaseing units, created CharaExists(overloaded) and GetAccountCharas to replace
 them.
[2006/10/06] - RaX - Removed old SQL.pas from project, still on SVN for posterities sake.
[2006/10/06] - RaX - Removed SQLConnected from MainProc (console.pas).

 above changes.
-

- Rev 30-
[2006/10/01] - Tsusai - Overview: Continued work on RaX's plug and play database system.

 from Character.pas
[2006/10/01] - Tsusai - CharaServerProcesses : Updated calls for the above changes.
Note : Database units not organized...was busy with functionality.  Also, need to verify
any use of TDatabase is cleaned up after we are done with it (FreeAndNil() or .Free).
-

- Rev 29-
[2006/09/30] - RaX - Updated new database organization, removed CreateDatabase and created
 a "wrapper" class for our Multi-database interface which, on create, decides what interface
 to use.
[2006/09/30] - RaX - Added - Classes/Database.pas
[2006/09/30] - RaX - Renamed - Classes/Database/Database.pas to DatabaseTemplate.pas.

 to Destroy.
-

[2006/09/29] - RaX - Overview - HUGE CHANGE, finally added our plug and play database system.
 this is, well, unique in RO emulators. The ability to swap between database types at the 
 flip of a switch is handy, of course, but giving people more choices in databasing is
 extremely useful.
[2006/09/29] - RaX - Added Classes/Database/Database.pas
[2006/09/29] - RaX - Added Classes/Database/MySQLDatabase.pas
[2006/09/29] - RaX - Added Constants/DatabaseConstants.pas

 mswindows/linux. Currently controls the IP to ip cardinal type used for RO clients to
 connect to a specified server.
[2006/07/05] - Tsusai - CharaServerTypes: Modified, IP is now a property.  Modifying it
 automatically updates IPCardinal.
[2006/07/05] - Tsusai - Common\SQL (Folder) added SQL.  It is GPL, but at this time I have
 contacted the author and am asking permission.  If declined, project would be either
 without SQL or be GPL.
[2006/07/05] - Tsusai - CharacterTypes: Added, basic TCharacter.  Eventually, EVERYTHING
 will be a property for instant SQL SELECT and UPDATE procedures.
[2006/07/05] - Tsusai - PacketTypes: Added TThreadLink type, from indy prometheus prototype.
 Helps link AThread.Data to actual TCharacter or TAccount.

 character server connect.  Also Added BASIC SQL retrieval.
[2006/07/05] - Tsusai - SaveDB: Killed a warning...I want to remove this after txt file
 load is redone so it is beautifully like SQL, with massive disk access (lol, probably do
 this like prommy).

[2006/07/04] - Tsusai - AccountTypes : Updated TAccount;

- Rev 40-
[2006/05/05] - RaX : Overview - CINCO DE MAYO, Reorganized a large part of the code.
[2006/05/05] - RaX : Moved Console commands back into TCommands class
[2006/05/05] - RaX : Reorganized startup messages into an outline format.
[2006/05/05] - RaX : Redid the main loop to allow TCommands.Exit to exit the loop.
[2006/05/05] - RaX : Added check at the beginning of TCommands.Parse to see if the string was
 blank, if it was blank, it would not exexute the parsing routine.
[2006/05/05] - RaX : Finally, I tested the changes. Everything checks out ok. There seems to 
 be no memory leaks, and it seems to be uncrashable. Hopefully this will be a good building
 block for the other servers.
-

- Rev 39-
[2006/05/04] - Tsusai : The original bug problem was that i was using a byte type for the
 loop. 0 to -1 crashes with the range error, due to the fact byte type cannot be less than 0.
  Fixed.
-

- Rev 38-
[2006/05/04] - RaX : Bugfix :: If there aren't any charaservers in charaserverlist, there
 would be a range error in loginprocesses.pas - SendCharaServers. Fixed with condition
 checking if there is a charaserver in the list.

- Rev 36 -
[2006/05/04] - Tsusai: Bugfix and added linux compatability
	Helios.dpr : added one of the few win/linux conditional defines.

[2006/05/04] - Tsusai - GUI removal and reorganization to accomidate.
	Helios.dpr : executes in a controlled loop to keep the application alive.

                      Commands.pas moved here
	Commands.pas : removed
	Socket.pas : removed tsocket class, but kept procedures.  Those procedures are
                     enough, don't need to create and destroy classes (memory) over and
                     over just yet. not till we have game objects in place.
	Database.pas : moved Reload here from Commands
