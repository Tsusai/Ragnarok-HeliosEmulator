- Rev 40-
[2006/05/05] - RaX : Overview - CINCO DE MAYO, Reorganized a large part of the code.
[2006/05/05] - RaX : Moved Console commands back into TCommands class
[2006/05/05] - RaX : Reorganized startup messages into an outline format.
[2006/05/05] - RaX : Redid the main loop to allow TCommands.Exit to exit the loop.
[2006/05/05] - RaX : Added check at the beginning of TCommands.Parse to see if the string was blank,
 if it was blank, it would not exexute the parsing routine.
[2006/05/05] - RaX : Finally, I tested the changes. Everything checks out ok. There seems to be no memory leaks,
 and it seems to be uncrashable. Hopefully this will be a good building block for the other servers.

- Rev 39-
[2006/05/04] - Tsusai : The original bug problem was that i was using a byte type for the loop.
  0 to -1 crashes with the range error, due to the fact byte type cannot be less than 0.  Fixed.

- Rev 38-
[2006/05/04] - RaX : Bugfix :: If there aren't any charaservers in charaserverlist, there would be a range error in
loginprocesses.pas - SendCharaServers. Fixed with condition checking if there is a charaserver in the list.
