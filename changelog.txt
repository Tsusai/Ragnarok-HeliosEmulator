- Rev 40-
[2006/05/05] - RaX : Overview - CINCO DE MAYO, Reorganized a large part of the code.
[2006/05/05] - RaX : Moved Console commands back into TCommands class
[2006/05/05] - RaX : Reorganized startup messages into an outline format.
[2006/05/05] - RaX : Redid the main loop to allow TCommands.Exit to exit the loop.

[2006/05/05] - RaX : Finally, I tested the changes. Everything checks out ok. There seems to 
 be no memory leaks, and it seems to be uncrashable. Hopefully this will be a good building
 block for the other servers.
-

- Rev 39-
[2006/05/04] - Tsusai : The original bug problem was that i was using a byte type for the
 loop. 0 to -1 crashes with the range error, due to the fact byte type cannot be less than 0.
  Fixed.
-

- Rev 38-
[2006/05/04] - RaX : Bugfix :: If there aren't any charaservers in charaserverlist, there
 would be a range error in loginprocesses.pas - SendCharaServers. Fixed with condition
 checking if there is a charaserver in the list.

- Rev 37-
forgot changelog
-

- Rev 36 -
[2006/05/04] - Tsusai: Bugfix and added linux compatability

                      Commands.pas moved here
	Commands.pas : removed
	Socket.pas : removed tsocket class, but kept procedures.  Those procedures are
                     enough, don't need to create and destroy classes (memory) over and
                     over just yet. not till we have game objects in place.
	Database.pas : moved Reload here from Commands

[2006/05/03] - RaX - Fixed bug from rev 29, AnAccount was being free'd after being added

[2006/05/03] - RaX - Added some more of the socket interface to the socket class, there's a
 bit more to go though. (SendBuffer was added, all Packet handling will be done by this class
 soon, and will make it easier to swap out sockets if need be).
-

- Rev 29 -
[2006/05/03] - RaX - Modified socket code to be accessed by a class, for flexibility. It's
 been tested and works.
