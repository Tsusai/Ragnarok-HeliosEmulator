- RaX

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Rev 46-
[2006/11/03] - RaX - Rewrote XTimer to fix problems with processors that modulate their
 clock speed. Changed resolution to seconds. We can't have lower resolutions until I figure
 out a better timer, so for now, we have seconds.
[2006/11/03] - RaX - Changed ini loading to load default 60 for SaveTimer.Interval.
[2006/11/03] - RaX - Changed Console.Pas to accomodate our new changes.
-

- Rev 45-
[2006/11/02] - RaX - Updated ThirdParty.txt to include Indy. Also, corrected mistakes made
 by yours truly in the umysqlclient credits. "There is no Spoof", you could say. Updated to
 "Part 10" of the GNU license.
-

- Rev 44-
[2006/11/01] - RaX - Map.pas - Implemented Tsusai's changed to GetPath which include, but
 are not limited to, the following...
	GetPath changed to a boolean function with APath as a parameter passed by address.
	Addition of IsBlocked to check for passability versus a multi-line condition.
[2006/11/01] - RaX - Map.pas - Added GetArea, a private method of TMap which creates a
 search area based on our constant CHAR_CLICKAREA distance away from the starting point.
[2006/11/02] - RaX - moved CHAR_CLICKAREA into Constants/GameConstants.pas.
[2006/11/02] - RaX - Added GameConstants.pas.
-

- Rev 43-
[2006/10/31] - RaX - Modified Map.pas - GetPath to return a TPointList instead of an Array
[2006/10/31] - RaX - moved constant CHAR_CLICKAREA to implementation,
 created Directions constant array of tpoints which contains the distance to go from the
 starting point to get the point in said direction.
[2006/10/31] - RaX - changed TMap.Graph to an array of array of TPoint.
-

- Rev 42-
[2006/10/30] - RaX - Added Classes/Map.Pas - our TMap map class. Stubbed, only contains our
 pathfinding algorithm for now. The Pathfinder is a "floodfill" or "wave" search that finds
 the shortest path between 2 points by flooding the graph with tracers that keep track of
 where they've been. The first one to reach the end's path is the shortest path.
-

- Rev 41-
[2006/10/23] - RaX - Random cleanup in LoginProcess, removed unused variables and function
 calls from our former Indy9 socket.
-

- Rev 40-
[2006/10/23] - RaX - Updated XTimer to have a Resolution property which is defined by constants
 to reflect the accuracy fo the timer, between nanoseconds and seconds. XTimer is now much
 more accurate than before as well.
[2006/10/23] - RaX - Added variables to ServerConfig to enable/disable and set the interval
 for the Save Loop.
-

- Rev 39-
[2006/10/21] - RaX - Re-Added XTimer.pas (it works correctly now, and better!) changed over
 SaveLoop.pas into what it was supposed to be, the save thread only, executed by XTimer.
 XTimer is now a reuseable timer with a real resolution of 1ms ...the defining element is
 assembly....go me. Will be updated to really get accurate time down to the clock speed of
 the processor (faster the clock speed, the more accurate the timer).
[2006/10/21] - RaX - Added our license to the header of Helios.dpr.
[2006/10/21] - RaX - Added ThirdParty.txt contents. Basic, but effective.
-

- Rev 38-
[2006/10/20] - Tsusai - Upgraded things to Indy 10. All old outstanding writebuffers now use
 Socket.SendBuffer.
[2006/10/20] - Tsusai - Console: Updated all TIdPeerThreads to TIdContext, and renamed
 AThread to AConnection.
[2006/10/20] - Tsusai - Socket: Updated SendPading to use SendBuffer.  SendBuffer now
 converts OUR buffer to Indy bytebits to send out (it took 3 hours to get sending to work
 right).  Also added a RecvBuffer, to handle recieving packets and putting them into a buffer.
[2006/10/20] - Tsusai - TCPServerRoutines: Updated threads to contexts in DeactivateServer.
[2006/10/20] - Tsusai - Login/Zone/Chara : Updated all peerthreads to contexts, removed
 ReadFromStack, redid the input buffer size call, and implemented SendBuffer (if missing)
 and RecvBuffer.
-

- Rev 37-
[2006/10/13] - Tsusai - Friday October 13th....Just as creepy as 06/06/06
[2006/10/13] - Tsusai - LoginProcesses: Separated the validation code from ParseLogin, and
 added MD5 client connection support.
-

- Rev 36-
[2006/10/10] - RaX - Code cleanup...
[2006/10/10] - RaX - moved Run from Helios.dpr to MainProc as a property for organization.
[2006/10/10] - RaX - Moved around save loop creates and destroys around in MainProc to make
 it force a save before the loop shuts down and free and recreate on restart.
[2006/10/10] - RaX - Added TSaveLoop.Save which will house the actual save code... to allow
 forcing a full save by simply calling this procedure from outside the thread.
-

- Rev 35-
[2006/10/09] - RaX - Fixed my timer. It wasn't allowing console commands (for some unknown
 reason). Removed XTimer, moved everything into SaveLoop...no more Enabled Property.
 {Thank you Tsusai}
-

- Rev 34-
[2006/10/06] - RaX - Updated XTimer.pas to work with Delphi 7 (Self.Ontimer(); vs OnTimer());
-

- Rev 33-
[2006/10/06] - RaX - Overview - stubbed out the save loop thread routines and built a timer
 for us to use.
[2006/10/06] - RaX - FIXED - Added CharaList.pas - forgot to last commit (sorry).
[2006/10/06] - RaX - Added SaveTimer to MainProc, a threaded Timer I wrote.
[2006/10/06] - RaX - Added TXTimer (Classes/XTimer.pas), a timer thread meant for the save.
 loop.
[2006/10/06] - RaX - Added TSaveLoop(Classes/SaveLoop.pas) - our Saving thread.
[2006/10/06] - RaX - How it works - The Timer runs in background forever. At Interval ms,
 it executes the saveloop, which runs outside of the execution path of both MainProc, and
 the timer itself. After saving, the SaveLoop automatically free's itself.
-

- Rev 32- BROKEN
[2006/10/06] - RaX - Finished implementation of the Database system and made it thread-safe
 (we now use a local, to the object instance, connection rather than the old global one.)
[2006/10/06] - RaX - CharaServerProcess - ripped out lingering sql queries and moved them 
 into the databaseing units, created CharaExists(overloaded) and GetAccountCharas to replace
 them.
[2006/10/06] - RaX - Removed old SQL.pas from project, still on SVN for posterities sake.
[2006/10/06] - RaX - Removed SQLConnected from MainProc (console.pas).
-

- Rev 31-
[2006/10/04] - Tsusai - Overview: Patched ZoneCore after running into multithread problems
 in Prometheus.
[2006/10/04] - Tsusai - DatabaseTXT: Updated TPacketProc to recieve a passed packet buffer.

 procedure.
[2006/10/04] - Tsusai - ZoneRecv : Updated the NoCommand procedure to be compatable by the
 above changes.
-

- Rev 30-
[2006/10/01] - Tsusai - Overview: Continued work on RaX's plug and play database system.
 Mainly delt with character database components.
[2006/10/01] - Tsusai - Console : Local Character server now using WAN_IP, not 127.0.0.1
[2006/10/01] - Tsusai - DatabaseTemplate/MySQLDatabase : Moved TCharacter SQL methods here
 from Character.pas
[2006/10/01] - Tsusai - CharaServerProcesses : Updated calls for the above changes.
Note : Database units not organized...was busy with functionality.  Also, need to verify
any use of TDatabase is cleaned up after we are done with it (FreeAndNil() or .Free).
-

- Rev 29-
[2006/09/30] - RaX - Updated new database organization, removed CreateDatabase and created
 a "wrapper" class for our Multi-database interface which, on create, decides what interface
 to use.
[2006/09/30] - RaX - Added - Classes/Database.pas
[2006/09/30] - RaX - Renamed - Classes/Database/Database.pas to DatabaseTemplate.pas.
[2006/09/30] - RaX - FIXED!!! - Random warnings from our umysql client, simply changed destroy
 to Destroy.
-

- Rev 28-
[2006/09/29] - RaX - Overview - HUGE CHANGE, finally added our plug and play database system.
 this is, well, unique in RO emulators. The ability to swap between database types at the 
 flip of a switch is handy, of course, but giving people more choices in databasing is
 extremely useful.
[2006/09/29] - RaX - Added Classes/Database/Database.pas
[2006/09/29] - RaX - Added Classes/Database/MySQLDatabase.pas
[2006/09/29] - RaX - Added Constants/DatabaseConstants.pas
[2006/09/29] - RaX - changed LoginProcesses to use the new database system rather than
 AccountDB.pas.
[2006/09/29] - RaX - removed AccountDB.pas from the project, still on SVN for history.
[2006/09/29] - RaX - Changed CharaServerProcesses to use the new database system.
[2006/09/29] - RaX - Modified ServerOptions.pas to include a DatabaseType variable.
 This variable determines which database Helios uses.
-

- Rev 27-
[2006/09/28] - RaX - ZoneCore - Started reorganization/re-documentation...
 make things a little easier to understand for newbies to the codebase =)
[2006/09/28] - RaX - ZoneCore - renamed variables, recased types, moved begins around.

 automatically updates IPCardinal.
[2006/07/05] - Tsusai - Common\SQL (Folder) added SQL.  It is GPL, but at this time I have
 contacted the author and am asking permission.  If declined, project would be either
 without SQL or be GPL.

- Rev 40-
[2006/05/05] - RaX : Overview - CINCO DE MAYO, Reorganized a large part of the code.
[2006/05/05] - RaX : Moved Console commands back into TCommands class
[2006/05/05] - RaX : Reorganized startup messages into an outline format.
[2006/05/05] - RaX : Redid the main loop to allow TCommands.Exit to exit the loop.
[2006/05/05] - RaX : Added check at the beginning of TCommands.Parse to see if the string was
 blank, if it was blank, it would not exexute the parsing routine.
[2006/05/05] - RaX : Finally, I tested the changes. Everything checks out ok. There seems to 
 be no memory leaks, and it seems to be uncrashable. Hopefully this will be a good building
 block for the other servers.

- Rev 39-
[2006/05/04] - Tsusai : The original bug problem was that i was using a byte type for the
 loop. 0 to -1 crashes with the range error, due to the fact byte type cannot be less than 0.
  Fixed.

- Rev 38-
[2006/05/04] - RaX : Bugfix :: If there aren't any charaservers in charaserverlist, there
 would be a range error in loginprocesses.pas - SendCharaServers. Fixed with condition
 checking if there is a charaserver in the list.

[2006/05/04] - Tsusai - GUI removal and reorganization to accomidate.
	Helios.dpr : executes in a controlled loop to keep the application alive.
	Console.pas : new console class of the application (MainProc).  Items from
                      Commands.pas moved here
	Commands.pas : removed
	Socket.pas : removed tsocket class, but kept procedures.  Those procedures are
                     enough, don't need to create and destroy classes (memory) over and
                     over just yet. not till we have game objects in place.
	Database.pas : moved Reload here from Commands
