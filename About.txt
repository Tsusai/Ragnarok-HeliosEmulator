I felt that I should include the true roots of Helios.
You may notice in the changelog, that there was around 30 revisions on another svn
server prior to this svn server.  Since those revisions were not fully copied over,
and just the latest revision, older revisions could've been lost.

Every folder number is an individual revision on the last OpenSVN server.
