Ragnarok-HeliosEmulator
=======================

(DISCONTINUED)  
Helios is a Ragnarok Online Emulator prototype.  
Was designed as a login server and character server test program, and expanded into an an awesome idea.  

*) One executable to run all the necessary servers, or use the same executable just as a single server.  
*) Dynamic Packet System (to adapt to client patches modifiying packets to throw off bots)  
*) Get off the questionable Weiss/nWeiss/Fusion/Prometheus core  
*) To prove a point that Delphi CAN run as a production server  

Obviously this is a discontinued project.  Code has been copied to Github for reference for knowledge.
