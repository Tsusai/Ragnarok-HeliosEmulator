[03/07/07] Tsusai [Status: Deprecated support for old client]
 PROBLEM: kRO exes from Oct 2006 increased a packet size of the character information
  packets used in creation's display and normal display from 106 to 108.   Currently there is no
  way to dynamicly check like what is possible for the zone.
 POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS:
  1) Modify the packet_db using the October 2006 client as the base.
  2) Character server ini flag, denoting if October 2006 and newer clients will be used.  This would
     be an one way or another.
